Come on, Frank.
Make up your mind!

00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,675
What are you smilin' about?

9
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:31,411
[boy] Dad, Grandpa's here!
[car horn honks]

00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:33,447
[sighs]

11
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,419
Welcome to your new home, Dad.

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,623
Smaller than I remember.

13
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,061
Sure got a lot of stuff,
Grandpa.

14
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:50,830
I can do that, Jordie.
I'm not an invalid.

15
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:52,632
Nobody thinks you're
an invalid, Eddie.

16
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,267
- Just want you to feel welcome.
- Eduardo.

17
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:58,507
- Huh?
- It's Eduardo, not Eddie.

18
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:02,511
Right. But, you know,
I could call you Dad.

19
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:07,280
Okay, Eduardo it is.

20
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,816
All right.
This is the last of it.

21
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:12,452
[grunts] Took you long enough.
Oh, oh, whoa.

22
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,087
Uh-huh. Okay.

23
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:17,157
Boy.
You know where I got this?

24
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,559
Judge Phillips,
state supreme court.

25
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,162
He gave me this when I appeared
before him on a federal case.

26
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:25,566
Said he never heard
a more solid argument

27
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:27,501
from an attorney
in his whole career.

28
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:28,569
Hmm.

29
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:30,604
Oh. Wow.

30
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:33,207
Well, I hope you
don't mind bunk beds.

31
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,876
Nah. I got used to
bunk beds, you know...

32
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:38,713
In the joint?
I prefer "the slammer."

33
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,818
All right, I gotta get back to work,
so I'll let you roommates settle in.

34
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,799
Dad. Dad?
Yeah?

35
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,070
Exactly how long is
Grandpa gonna be staying here?

36
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,505
I don't really know, Son.

37
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,443
Dad, I need my space.

38
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:10,445
Of course you do. Look... your mother
and I are gonna work something out, okay?

39
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,314
But in the meantime,
we're stuck with him.

40
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:14,316
So make the best
of it, all right?

41
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:15,787
Whatever.

42
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:27,798
Potatoes are a little salty.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,568
[exhales]

44
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,669
I just put a bit in the water, Dad.
To give it some flavor.

45
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,172
[chuckling]

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,277
Salt's no good for ya.
It makes you retain fluid.

47
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,748
Weakens the muscle. You end
up lookin' like your dad.

48
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,183
I still weigh the same
as I did in the joint.

49
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,220
Here, feel that.

50
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,190
So, any plans tomorrow, Dad?

51
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,358
Ah, you know, the usual.

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,461
Meet up with
a couple of friends...

53
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:00,564
have some coffee,
complain about the weather.

54
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:03,202
Well, I'll be teaching tomorrow,
but maybe Frank can drive you.

55
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,405
Mm-mm.
Frank's gotta write.

56
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,508
You still keepin'
up with that, huh?

57
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,312
Let's see...
What was your last book?

58
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:17,814
<i>The Copenhagen Conundrum.</i>

59
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,483
That was, what,
ten years ago?

60
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,888
- Five.
- Oh.

61
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:24,422
Eh, close enough.

62
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:27,594
Thought you would've
given up on that by now.

63
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,431
Bird's dry.

64
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:51,383
[Frank] I don't think
this is gonna work.

65
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,852
What do you mean?

66
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:55,020
Well, for one thing,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable

67
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:57,356
livin' with an ex-con
under our roof.

68
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:00,626
That is my father
you're talking about, Frank.

69
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,862
And that was a long time ago.

70
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:04,931
He paid his debt to society.

71
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,666
He even got his law degree
when he was in jail.

72
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,268
Doesn't that
count for something?

73
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,970
Well, if he's such
a hotshot lawyer,

74
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,039
why can't he stay
in his apartment?

75
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:17,377
Because he almost burned it down
when he forgot to turn off the stove.

76
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,278
Oh, that.

77
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,914
And then
the neighbors complained

78
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,450
about him knocking
on their doors at all hours

79
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,785
tryin' to get into
the wrong apartment.

80
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:29,355
And when the landlord found him
sleeping under the fountain...

81
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,391
he said it was
the last straw.

82
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,428
Yeah.
Well, if it's that bad, honey...

83
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:37,430
maybe it's time that
we put him in a home.

84
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:40,501
[laughs]
He is in a home.

85
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:42,237
Our home.

86
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,406
Don't worry
about Dad, hmm?

87
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,745
You probably won't even
notice that he's here.

88
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:52,615
[Eduardo snoring]

89

[school bell ringing]

91
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:37,829
They workin' yet?

92
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,730
What?
Your psychic powers.

93
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:44,600
You stare at her every day,
but you never talk to her.

94
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:48,406
So the only way she's ever gonna know that
you're interested is if she can read your mind.

95
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,536
Hey, I was just texting you.
Meet you in the caf?

96
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,409
Hey.

97
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,577
Oh. Hi.

98
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,046
Jordan, right?

99
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,180
You know my name?

100
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,450
You're in my physics class.
I'm Annie.

101
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,087
Oh.
Nice to meet you.

102
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,889
Officially, that is.

103
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,658
You're trying out for the show?
Huh?

104
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,697
The variety show.
Let me guess, you sing?

105
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,499
Uh, uh... Yeah, sing.

106
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,537
Great. Me too.
There I am.

107
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,641
There you are.
There you are.

108
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,909
Well, I guess I'll see you
at the auditions?

109
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,914
Maybe we can sing together.

110
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:04,919
Sing.

111
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,989

Eduardo, you scared
the crap outta me.

117
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,911
Yeah, but you used
the wrong word.

118
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:34,014
Th-The word
should be "implied."

119
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:38,120
The speaker implies,
the listener infers.

120
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:42,956
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

121
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,725
You know, funny thing
happened to me once. Okay.

122
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:49,729
I was arguing a case in front
of Judge Hightower, right?

123
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:54,734
Now every attorney in the district
knows this guy is a class A moron.

Okay, okay.

125
00:08:56,272 --> 00:09:00,007
He used the word "infer"
incorrectly just like you did.

126
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,910
[laughing] Yes, just like...
Okay, listen, Eduardo.

127
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,912
I-I'd love to hear
more about this,

128
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,581

the thing is I'm kinda workin'.

Yeah. Okay.

135
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:30,138
I thought a man
in your situation

136
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,744
might appreciate a little
constructive criticism.

137

Wait. "My situation"?
What's that mean?

exactly Book-of-the-Month Club, are you?

No. You're like

Do you have
to play it so loud?

What the hell is vinegar time?

Half a cup of vinegar,
twice a day.

Better than any
medication out there.

00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:22,421
Want some?
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

161
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:25,691
Hey, did you see some
leftover Thai food in here?

162
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:26,926
I was savin' it for lunch.

163
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:30,262
[gurgling, laughing]

164
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:32,431
[grunts]

165
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,102
Threw it out.

166
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,372
Got enough chemicals, enough
salt, enough preservatives,

167
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,709
enough MSG
to kill a water buffalo.

168
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,080
Yeah. Um... [clears throat]
Okay, look, Eduardo...

169
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,950
I know this is a difficult situation
for both of us... [gargling]

170
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:53,086
...but irregardless of that,
I think it would be helpful

171
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,388
if we set some ground rules
right off the bat.

172
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,792
What do you think?

173
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:00,961
"Regardless."

174
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:02,129
What?

175
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,364
You meant "regardless."

176
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:06,133
Or, maybe, "irrespective."

177
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,971
But there's no such word
as "irregardless."

178
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,208
Thanks, Eduardo.

179
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,010
Yo.
Okay, good.

180
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:17,013
Yeah.

181
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:49,280
[exhales]

182
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:53,149
I thought we already
paid the property tax?

183
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:56,251
Nah, nah.
That one was for last year.

184
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,120
This one is for this year,
which we didn't pay

185
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,988
because we needed the money
for the mortgage.

186
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,858
All right, well,
we'll figure it out.

187
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,962
We always do.

188
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,329
We'd be fine if I could
just finish my novel.

189
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,031
How'd it go today?

190
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,401
Before the polka music
or after?

191
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:13,770
Dad?
Yeah.

192
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:16,239
He's either standin' over me
correctin' my spelling,

193
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:19,275
or thumpin' through the house
criticizin' my dietary habits.

194
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:21,978
Oh, he's just lonely, honey.
Yes. Yes.

195
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,113
It's been five years
since Mom died,

196
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:26,015
but I know
he still misses her.

197
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,885
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I totally get it.

198
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,287
But, babe,
I'm a writer, okay?

199
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,726
And I can't write
if I have to babysit your dad.

200
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:40,097
Hey. [chuckles] I just got an idea.
Hmm?

201
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:43,833
Why doesn't he invite some
friends over here tomorrow?

202
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,236
What, seriously?
Yeah.

203
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:48,038
What, you want me to take care
of a houseful of Eduardos?

204
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,974
No, that's the point.

205
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,377
And they take care
of each other.

206
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,182
They keep each other company,
so you can get back to work.

207
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:58,485
Hmm.

208
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,820
What do you think?

209
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,355
[jazz music playing]

210
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:07,091
Read 'em and weep. Straight
to the king. [laughs]

211
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:10,027
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[laughs]

212
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,832
Arnold is already
showing a flush.

213
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,067
A straight beats a flush!

214
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,335
You're full of crap!

215
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:19,870
What are you yelling for?

216
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:23,008
We're playing for matchsticks,
for crying out loud!

217
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,111
Okay, we got you all set up.
Snacks, beer in the fridge.

218
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,980
Gabe, what difference
does it make?

219
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,614
It makes a difference
in principle.

220
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,550
A straight beats a flush,
right, Arnold?

221
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,487
Only when
it's a straight flush.

222
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,023
That's it. That's it.
He's right.

223
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:39,859
You guys are cheaters.
You're just a bunch of cheaters.

224
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:41,893
Hey, hey, hey!
You can't say that.

225
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,962
I'm a certified
public accountant,

226
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:45,298
and we never cheat!

227
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,100
- Have fun.
- Ah, poker.

228
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:50,637
I wondered
what I was going to be doing

229
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,408
until I died.

230
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:55,143
[whispers]
All right, baby.

231
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,179
Yes, sir.

232
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,316
Mm-hmm.

233
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,590
[exhales, inhales]

234
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,892
[exhales sharply]

235
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,427
[typing]

236
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,264
Hey! Where's the john?

237
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,898
Gabe.

238
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,602
- John.
- Okay.

239
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,572
[sighs]

240
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,640
Down the hall,
first door on the left.

241
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,610
Bladder's on its last legs.

242
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,217
All right.

243
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:40,190
[thumping]
[sighs]

244
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,392
[muttering]
How do you work this thing?

245
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:47,228
Never mind. That thing's bad
for the environment, anyway.

246
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,063
I brought old Betsy.

247
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,567
So, what's the deal
on that, Eddie?

248
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,002
I thought you didn't
even like your son-in-law.

249
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,940
What're you doing
living in his house?

250
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:58,642
Uh...

251
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,144
Well, they were having
kind of a rough time

252
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:05,113
and asked me to move in
and help out a bit.

253
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:08,317
That's a good thing.
Yes.

254
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,055
Multigenerational families
can be very rewarding.

255
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,593
Wait until the first time you
forget where you put your milk,

256
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,695
and then they find it
in your sock drawer.

257
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:22,066
Never get a reward
for that one.

258
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,237
Whoa!

259
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:30,508
[Eduardo] Hey, Frank!
Lights went out!

260
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:38,448
All right, Arnold.
See you later, perpetrator.

261
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,651
All right, my man. Be good.
Walter.

262
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:43,052
<i>Ciao.
Ciao bella.</i>

263
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:44,687
All right, Gabe.
Take it easy.

264
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:47,658
Wait for me in the car, Dad.
I'll be right there. Yeah.

265
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,262
Oh, Frank. Thank you so much
for watching Dad all day.

266
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,030
Ah, it's no problem. I can
tell that he had a lot of fun.

267
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:57,635
I was wondering if maybe he could
come back again sometime soon?

268
00:16:57,637 --> 00:17:01,138
Uh... Well, you know, Denise,
this was kind of a one-time thing.

269
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,574
I'm not sure if we're gonna make
it a regular event. I mean...

270
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:06,744
I could help with the expenses. No,
no, I mean, that's not necessary.

271
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:08,746
Please. You would be
doing me a huge favor.

272
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:11,449
Here. At least take 100.
The senior home charges 300.

273
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,384
What, $300 per person?

274
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:15,021
Per day.

275
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,458
You don't say?

276
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,495
No, no. I mean, we could fit a dozen
or so people in the house at once.

277
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:25,497
I mean, if we charge
100 bucks a day...

278
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:28,400
Okay, well, you wanna bring
12 people into our living room?

279
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:31,603
No, no, no.
Not people, Emma. Clients.

280
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:33,538
[scoffs] I don't know, Frank.

281
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,208
It's a lot of work taking
care of senior citizens.

282
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,744
You're the one that said that they
could take care of each other.

283
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:40,480
What do I know
about senior citizens?

284
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm a high school teacher.
Oh.

285
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:44,817
Hey, Dad.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

286
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,520
Not right now, Jordie. Your mom
and I are discussin' something.

287
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:48,788
It sounds like you're arguing.

288
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,325
Don't you have homework?

289
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,727
Thanks, Dad.

290
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:56,596
[sighs] The truth is,
we need the money.

291
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:58,331
Let's just try it for one week.
What do you say?

292
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,634
[sighs]

293
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,671
Hello? Hi, Denise.

294
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:08,374
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Frank Collins.
We met the other day?

295
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:10,811
Yes, exactly.
How are you? Good, good.

296
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:14,015
Listen, Denise, how would you
like a place to put your dad?

297
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,352
I sure did.

298
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:35,304
[chuckles]

299
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:41,744
Here.

300
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,449
Dad?
Yeah.

301
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,351
I really need to talk
to you about something.

302
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:52,520
Can it wait, Jordan? I'm
a little busy right now.

303
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,223
Excuse me.
[sighs]

304
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,460
Had breakfast yet?
I'll get something at school.

305
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:03,499
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Your body is a machine.

306
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,166
You gotta keep it fueled up.
Here.

307
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:07,835
Homemade granola.

308
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:13,176
I always keep a couple handfuls
in my pocket, just in case.

309
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:22,620
Thanks, Grandpa.

310
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,460
Hey. What're you doin'?

311
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,263
Well, it was so nice havin'
your friends over the other day,

312
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,600
I thought maybe
we'd invite some more.

313
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,200
I don't have
any more friends.

314
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:39,502
[doorbell rings]

315
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,172

Thank you very much.
Cash or check is appreciated.

318
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,449
Of course, we prefer cash,
but we're not picky.

319
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:55,385
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Hey, how are ya?

320
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,355
Good to see you, good to... Thank

321
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,224
Go right on in. Plenty of seating.
Lots of snacks.

322
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:03,259
That's great.
Thank you, thank you.

323
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,261
Hey, Gabe!
How are you, man?

324
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:06,365
Bye, Pops.

325
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:12,670
Gabe, what the hell
are you doin' here?

326
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:15,208
I don't know, but Denise said
I had to show up.

327
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,244
[Frank] Okay. All right.
I'll see you later. Bye.

328
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:31,722
All righty.
Okay, you guys.

329
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:33,290
I'm Frank.

330
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,292
[sighs]

331
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:37,361
Hi, everybody.
Nice to see you guys.

332
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:38,964
How about goin' around
the room, you know,

333
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,632
gettin' to know each other
a little bit.

334
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,502
Tell us a little somethin'
about yourselves.

335
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:49,241
Uh... Sure, I'm Lou.
They call me Big Lou.

336
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:54,680
Uh... 75. I fought in 'Nam,
got a Purple Heart.

337
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:57,416
Again with the Purple Heart.

Still counts.

340
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,494
And I'm Bonnie.
I'm his wife.

341
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:10,932
Yeah, like
they couldn't tell.

342
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:15,301
Oh, I-I guess I don't
need to introduce myself.

343
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,536
Mm.

344
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:18,572
[chuckles]

345
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:22,644
Oh! I'm Dan North.

346
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:29,951
Dynamite Dan, the Van Man?
See? Yeah? Mmm?

347
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,591
Our prices are explosive.
[mimics explosion]

348
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,459
Oh, yeah!
I remember those commercials.

349
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,027
You used to blow stuff up.

350
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,562
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

351
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,031
What'd you say?

352
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:47,670
I said you used to blow stuff up
in the commercials.

353
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:50,504
I'm sorry.
I don't hear very well anymore.

354
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,676
[louder] I used to blow stuff up
in my commercials.

355
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:54,877
[clears throat]

356
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:02,318
Oh. I remember that place.
Isn't it a yogurt shop now?

357
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,486
Huh?

358
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:06,353
Oh, oh, I can't do yogurt.

359
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,022
It gives me the whoopsies.

360
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,556
What the hell are
the whoopsies?

361
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,828
My name is Millie,
and these are my grandchildren.

362
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,965
Do you wanna see them?

363
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,902
This one is Alicia.
Isn't she cute?

364
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,003
And this is...
Oh, this is Owen.

365
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:24,907
And this is Candice,
and this...

366
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,510
Oh, this is Timothy,

367
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,912
and his twin sister is Tammy.
I'll show you her.

368
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:34,415
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna let you
guys get acquainted with each other.

369
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,752
I'm gonna leave you guys here.
How about some TV, maybe?

370
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,521
[Gabe]
Hey! It's almost 11:00.

371
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,655
We can watch
<i>Guess My Price Tag!</i>

372
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:41,924
[Walter] All right, all right.
Oh, yes.

373
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,293
<i>Guess My Price Tag!</i>

374
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:46,796
All right.
That's comin' on.

375
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,498
You guys, again, please
help yourselves with snacks.

376
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,538
And if there's anything
that you need, um, ask Eduardo.

377
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,041
Sorry. What'd he say?

378
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,943
[school bell ringing]
[Kenny] So, you tell her yet?

379
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,578
[Jordan sighs]
Are you kidding?

380
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,080
If I tell Annie the only reason
I signed up for the audition

381
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,116
was because I wanted to
talk to her, she's gonna...

382
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,385
She's gonna think you're even more
of a creep than you already are?

383
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,754
Thanks.

384
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,756
Hey, Jordan.

385
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,791
Have you picked
out your song yet?

386
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,027
Uh, my song?
Yeah.

387
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,496
You know,
for your audition?

388
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,932
I'm doing "My Heart Will
Go On." I love Céline.

389
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:26,403
Yeah.
She can really... sing.

390
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,072
[chuckles]
Well, better pick one soon.

391
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,943
Audition's in two weeks.

392
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,414
"Yeah.
She can really, uh, sing."

393
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,951
Shut up!

394
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,422
[loudly] No! See?
Now you've turned it off!

395
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,159
The input button! You were
supposed to push the input button!

396
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,560
What're you talkin' about?
I got one of these at home.

397
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,597
What are we supposed to do with these
games? They're all missing pieces.

398
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,800
Ah, forget about that. Will you rub my leg?
It's actin' up.

399
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,568
Rub your own leg.

400
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,974
Here. My son gave me these
when my lumbago acts up.

401
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:04,844
Mm. Thank you.
Let's see.

402
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,780
Oh, that's good.

403
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,717
Mm-hmm.
The pain goes right away.

404
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:14,087
You wanna try one?
Oh. Thanks.

405
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,989
I get some pain too.
Can I have one?

406
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:17,625
Be my guest.

407
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,859
[loudly] Hey!
What?

408
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:22,728
You want one?
Sure!

409
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,030
Thank you.

410
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:27,600
These are actually
pretty good.

411
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,137
What's in these things?

412
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:45,818
What if we're all just...

413
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,925
tiny, little microbes
on this gigantic organism?

414
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:53,893
And what if that organism...

415
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:57,499
is a microbe
on another organism?

416
00:24:58,134 --> 00:24:59,769
Ooh.

417
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,037

Again, Frank?

425
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:57,793
You know, I came to this same dead
end in T <i>he Peruvian Principle.</i>

426
00:25:57,795 --> 00:26:01,298
Then again in <i>The Romanian</i>
<i>Rituals</i> and <i>The Warsaw Wire.</i>

427
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,599
Which, by the way, was not
one of your better titles.

428
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:06,335
- So?
- So...

429
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:09,638
maybe that's why you're having such
a hard time finishing this book.

430
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,343
Maybe I'm not the only one
stuck in a dead end.

00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,952
Hey, could you call
the fire department

441
00:26:54,954 --> 00:26:57,922
and ask them to send us some firemen?
[giggles]

00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:14,468
- Whack it!
- Push the reset button!

473
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,304
- Whack it!
- Which button is the reset button?

474
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:19,406
Well, I don't know.
It's your house!

475
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,308
Whack it, whack it, whack it!

476
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,477
[all shouting, screaming]

477
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,347
[alarm voice] <i>Fire! Fire!</i>

478
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:27,384
Oh. Oh.

479
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:29,483
[beeping stops]

480
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:32,052
Well, what do you know?
A reset button.

481
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:34,054
[phone rings]
Is it off?

482
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:36,191
[Frank groans]
Yeah.

483
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:37,427
Son?

484
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:41,195
Can you feel your feet?
Yeah, I felt that.

485
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,732
Hold on.

486
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:46,770
Frank, here, it's for you.

487
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,373
[clears throat] Hello?

488
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:54,509
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.
Okay, yeah. Bye-bye.

489
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,880
[groans] Okay.

490
00:28:57,381 --> 00:28:59,382
I'm all right.

491
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:01,852
Whoo! The alarm company
wanted to know...

492
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:04,321
[alarm voice, distorted]
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

493
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:10,395
Got anymore popcorn?

494
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,397
[Emma] You sure you're okay?

495
00:29:13,264 --> 00:29:15,097
Yeah, it was just
a little bump on the head.

496
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,831
And a fall down the stairs.

497
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,168
And I was almost
suffocated by chemical foam.

498
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,538
But judgin' by the numbers,
it was all worth it.

499
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,275
You're lucky that's all
that happened to you.

500
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,244
Eduardo,
thank you for caring.

501
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,045
I'm not talkin' about you,
you idiot.

502
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:32,048
I'm talkin' about that whole
houseful of people you had.

503
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,950
This whole place
could've gone up.

504
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,918
Hold on, now. Aren't you
exaggerating a little bit?

505
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,955
Try this on for size.

506
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:43,092
You're operating an illegal social
service facility out of your house.

507
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:44,463
That's not an exaggeration.

508
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:49,132
Honey, maybe this isn't
such a good idea after all.

509
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:51,868
Well, how about this money?
Hmm?

510
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,004
That's a pretty good idea,
wouldn't you say?

511
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:56,406
Until I finish my book, it's the
only thing standin' between us

512
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,141
and gettin' kicked
out of our house.

513
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,812
Or, you get a real job.

514
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,348
Dad.

515
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,215
No, no. No, honey.

516
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:07,552
I like hearin' what
he really thinks about me.

517
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:10,154
He never thought I was good
enough for his daughter, anyway.

518
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:12,257
[scoffs] That's not true, Frank.
Really?

519
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,259
Ask him.

520
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:15,829
Dad?

521
00:30:17,264 --> 00:30:19,232
I stand on the Fifth.

522
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:24,104
Let me tell you somethin',
Frank.

523
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:28,906
A long time ago,
I made a mistake.

524
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:30,977
Cost me a lot of years.

525
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:34,946
I missed watchin'
my daughter grow up.

526
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:38,851
And I promised myself
when I got out of the joint,

527
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:41,453
I would keep my nose clean.

528
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:46,127
Now, this is your house,
so you can do whatever you want,

529
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,896
but you count me out.

530
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,245
[Frank] What if he's right?

531
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:07,547
Of course he's not right.

532
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:09,949
Writing is a real job.

533
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,053
Just because you haven't
sold a book in five years

534
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:15,556
and you're not making
any money at the moment...

535
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:18,058
and you've got a deadline you're
probably not gonna meet...

536
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,527
you feel like a failure,
I mean, it doesn't mean that...

537
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:23,566
Yeah, actually, I wasn't
talkin' about the writing.

538
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,600
Oh.

539
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:29,069
- [door slams]
- [Eduardo breathes heavily]

540
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:31,441
Eduardo?
Are you all right?

541
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,642
Who the hell are you?

542
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,012
Dad?

543
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,312
What are you doin' in my house?

544
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,217
No, no, no, Eduardo,
you're in our house. Hey.

545
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:46,153
- Where am I?
- Shh, you're just havin' a bad dream, Dad.

546
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,388
It's all right.

547
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,458
What are you doin'...
Where are you takin' me?

548
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,327
What...?

549
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:53,296
Esmeralda!

550
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:56,966
[Emma] Just
a little more water, Dad.

551
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,072
Good.

552
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:06,675
[Jordan]
Is Grandpa gonna be okay?

553
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,510
[Emma] Yes. Yeah.

554
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:11,079
He's just a little bit
confused, that's it.

555
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,349
He's gonna be fine.

556
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:21,392
All right.
Go back to bed, Jordie.

557
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:29,634
[Frank sighs]

558
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:38,977
[sighs]

559
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:41,146
It's okay, Eduardo.

560
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,381
It's okay.

561
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,127
[Frank] All right.
Millie, two pills once daily.

562
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:01,331
Thank you very much. Hey, Dan.
And what've we got here?

563
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,535
Uh, one twice a day. All right, thank you.
Yeah, one twice a day.

564
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,437
Thank you. Hey!

565
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:09,306
Big Lou. We have once
every three hours. Got it.

566
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:11,776
Do me a favor and double his dose?
It keeps him calm.

567
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:14,312
Copy that. With you as my
wife, we should triple it.

568
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:19,216
- [woman] Come on, Mom, let's go.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

569
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:21,619
Hi. I'm Beverly.
This is my mother, Blanche.

570
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,120
Hi, Blanche.
Hello.

571
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:25,559
Actually,
we don't take drop-ins, but...

572
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:31,228
But we will definitely
make an exception. [laughs]

573
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,098
I need someplace to put her during the
day until my father's probate closes.

574
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,633
Everywhere else in town
has a waiting list.

575
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:37,636
Bev, I'm fine
living by myself.

576
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:40,538
Don't argue, Mom!
I'm already late for a meeting.

577
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,173
- Could she stay?
- Uh...

578
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:44,409
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to impose.

579
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:47,111
Well, it... No imposition at all.
We'd love to have you.

580
00:33:47,113 --> 00:33:48,514
Great.
Thank you.

581
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:49,648
I'll pick her up at five.
Good.

582
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,517
Thank you.
All right.

583
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,320
Blanche.
Yes?

584
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:56,355
You play horseshoes, girl?
Let's see.

585
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:57,991
Okay.
[Frank chuckles]

586
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:04,064
Hmm.

587
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:14,075
[radio beeps] Ned Tooley to headquarters.
We have a situation.

588
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:26,255
[chuckles]

589
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:32,194
[polka playing]

590
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:36,631
You stepped over the line. That's cheating!
What are you talkin' about?

591
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:37,765
What? I can't hear you.

592
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:40,200
Just a little more
on your nose.

593
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,435
You know how sensitive
you are to the sun.

594
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,872
I look like
a damn French mime.

595
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,675
And this is my
great-grandson, Duncan.

596
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,111
He's a professional
waffle maker,

597
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:54,147
and he works at one of the best
Waffle Houses in Pittsburgh.

598
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:56,216
And you...
Would you excuse me?

599
00:34:56,218 --> 00:34:57,820
Oh, sure, sure.

600
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,495
[polka continues]

601
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,298
Oh!

602
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:11,401
- Excuse me.
- Hi, can I help you?

603
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:14,171
I was just looking
for the ladies room.

604
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:16,838
Down the hall to the left.

605
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,611
Ah. Thank you.
Nice music.

606
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,413
You like polka?

607
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:25,149
[chuckles]
Doesn't everybody?

608
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:27,184
Thank you.

609
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,861
Hey, Eduardo! Come over here and
help me beat this cheatin' rat!

610
00:35:38,195 --> 00:35:39,163
Okay, now, what'd you say?

611
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,435
You're not playin'?

612
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,337
I never learned.

613
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,341
[chuckles] It's an easy game.
I'll teach you, if you like.

614
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:54,377
Over here, just, like,
swing back like this.

615
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:55,645
Your arm back.
Look here.

616
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:56,913
Sure. Here,
let me show you.

617
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,849
Okay. Here we go. Swing it back.

618
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:01,284
There you go. All the way back.
That's it.

619
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,686
Wow, Blanche,
you're really graceful.

620
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,723
[Blanche] Huh?

621
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:07,624
I was a dancer.
On Broadway.

622
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,892
Really?
Mm.

623
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:11,564
Understudy
in <i>West Side Story.</i>

624
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:15,232
Yeah, never made
it onstage, though.

625
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:18,203
Damn Chita Rivera.
She never missed a show.

626
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:26,911
Uh? Okay, you know what? Uh, just swing
it one, two, three, and let it go.

627
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:27,913
Oh. Okay.

628
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:35,285
I'm only askin' for an extension
on the deadline, Harry. No.

629
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:37,355
Man, it's not like
I'm sittin' around

630
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:39,426
waitin' for inspiration
to hit me on the head.

631
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:48,168
Let me call you back.
[doorbell rings]

632
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,437
[Frank sighs]

633
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:53,738
Hey, can I help you?
Hi! Ned Tooley.

634
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,340
Department of Social Services.

635
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:57,977
I have a few questions about your business.
May I come in?

636
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,913
Uh... Sure, come on in.
No!

637
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:03,015
Eduardo, what's the matter?
Shut up, Frank.

638
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:04,616
[Frank] Okay.

639
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:06,818
Do you have a warrant
to enter the premises?

640
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,287
No. This is just
a friendly visit.

641
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,192
Okay. Let's be friends
on the porch, okay?

642
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,961
Close the door, Frank.

643
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,700
How can
we help you, sir?

644
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:22,635
Oh, yes, I have
a couple questions.

645
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:26,405
How long have you been operating
an elder day care facility?

646
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,908
Oh, I'd say...
Don't answer that, Frank.

647
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,643
I'm sorry.
Are you Mr. Collins' attorney?

648
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:32,411
No, no, I'm Mr. Collins'
father-in-law.

649
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:33,512
All right, then.

650
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:37,350
Do you have a license
to operate a day care facility?

651
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:38,685
You know, technically I...
Don't answer that, Frank.

652
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:40,586
Oh, fine.

653
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:42,889
I can see we're not gonna
get anywhere here today.

654
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:45,459
But I will tell you this,
Mr. Collins.

655
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:48,495
If you don't have a license
to operate a day care facility,

656
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:51,832
I, with the powers invested in me by
the city Social Services Department,

657
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:54,770
will be forced
to shut you down.

658
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:57,841
I shall return.

659
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:00,476
Have a nice day.

660
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:08,515
Thanks.
That was very impressive.

661
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:10,918
First year law student
could've handled that.

662
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,855
I told you. You're gonna need
a license for this place.

663
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:16,624
So, what do I do now?

664
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:20,394
I know that kind of guy.
He'll be back tomorrow.

665
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:23,000
And city hall closes at 5:00.

666
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:26,668
Well, we better
get down there.

667
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,737
What are you gonna do with
all the people in your backyard?

668
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,374
[sighs]

669
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,746
Ah.
[clears throat]

670
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,949
Frank, can ya pull in somewhere?
I gotta go to the bathroom.

671
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,519
Didn't I tell ya to go
before we got in the car?

672
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,021
I did.
I have to go again.

673
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,024
Well, now you'll just have
to wait till we get there.

674
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,727
Suit yourself.
It's not my van.

675
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,996
And that's my son's
second wife. Or third.

676
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:58,701
Oh, well, they all kind of
blend together after a while.

677
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,136
[laughing]

678
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,507
My kids wanna put me
in a nursing home.

679
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:06,109
Why didn't you tell them
you don't wanna go?

680
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,576
Yeah, I did.

681
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,946
And they're trying
to get a court order

682
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:12,782
so they can stick me
in one anyway.

683
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,418
They really want the money
my Henry left me.

684
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,386
You have to get a lawyer.

685
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,955
Who can afford a lawyer?

686
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,390
[bee buzzing]
[Dan] Frank?

687
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:23,560
- Yeah?
- Frank! There's a bee in here!

688
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,129
All right, well,
just leave it alone.

689
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:28,631
- Stay calm.
- Ooh, I'm allergic to bees.

690
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,933
No!
How allergic?

691
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,903
If I get stung,
I might not die.

692
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:35,072
Hey, listen.
Don't make it angry, okay?

693
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:37,175
Bees get nasty
when they're angry.

694
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:39,044
Just let it go
out the window.

695
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,613
- I got it! I got it!
- You're doing that on purpose.

696
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:44,748
- Whack it! Whack it!
- I think it's already angry.

697
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,118
You know, it's after me.
It wants my cologne.

698
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,686
Would you pull over?
Pull over!

699
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:51,922
I can't pull over.
I'm driving, Dan.

700
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:53,791
I'll get it.

701
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:55,628
Hey, Gabe, Gabe...

702
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,763
I bruise easily. Please.

703
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,198
[screaming]
What?

704
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,167
- It stung me!
- Oh, my gosh.

705
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:04,870
In my purse!
I have my EpiPen!

706
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,171
[Blanche] Where is it?
Where is it?

707
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:07,839
In my purse there.

708
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:10,175
- Do something!
- I just need you to calm down.

709
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,810
What do I do?
What do I do?

710
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:14,013
Put it here,
on my thigh.

711
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:15,513
- Do something!
- I'll get it!

712
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:17,551
[screaming]

713
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:21,122
[all screaming]

714
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:27,692
Whoo. Whoo.

715
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:30,963
[R & B music playing]

716
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:33,900
[bee buzzing] There's your bee.
It's still alive.

717
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:37,904
Oh, you know what?
I didn't get stung after all.

718
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:40,006
It was just my broach.

719
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:42,475
There it goes,
out the window.

720
00:40:42,477 --> 00:40:43,876
No casualties.

721
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:46,181
Yeah.
No casualties.

722
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:48,650
[sighs]

723
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:52,120
[man singing]

724
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:03,596
Why are we here again?

725
00:41:03,598 --> 00:41:05,901
What? You say I never
take you anywhere.

726
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:22,786
[bell dinging]

727
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:25,920
Doesn't work.

728
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:27,654
Thank you.

729
00:41:27,656 --> 00:41:29,723
All right then,
everything seems to be in order.

730
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,225
That'll be $90.

731
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:36,030
That is great.
Here you go.

732
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:37,068
Thank you.

733
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:49,545
Next.
Excuse me.

734
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:50,813
What about our license?

735
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:53,483
Oh, certainly.
Let me just check.

736
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:58,687
The current processing time
is 12 to 18 months.

737
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:00,122
Eighteen months?

738
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:02,125
Yes. Sometimes
it's closer to 12,

739
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:04,193
and other times
it's closer to 18.

740
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:05,894
That's why
we give you a range.

741
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:07,730
No, I need this license today!

742
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:09,767
Oh, well.

743
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:14,904
Then you probably should have
applied 18 months ago. Or 12.

744
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:16,107
Next.

745
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:18,174
Where's the bathroom?

746
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:20,212
Right around
the corner, sir.

747
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:23,582
[rock and roll playing]

748
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:28,987
What can I get you all?

749
00:42:29,855 --> 00:42:32,524
I'll have the special.
Yeah, the special's good.

750
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:34,991
I'll have the special.

751
00:42:34,993 --> 00:42:38,062
Yeah, I guess I'll have
the special too, yeah.

752
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:40,597
All right.
And I'll have the special.

753
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,966
Y'all are easy.
What are you guys having?

754
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:44,536
[all loudly] The special!

755
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,904
What's the special?

756
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:49,707
Nine-ounce filet mignon
in a peppercorn sauce,

757
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,776
almond rice pilaf,
and a side of corn on the cob.

758
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:57,717
I'm lactose intolerant. Can you
substitute chicken for the steak?

759
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:01,018
Sure.

760
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,686
May I have the
corn off the cob?

761
00:43:03,688 --> 00:43:06,223
No cob.
I'll just have the special.

762
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:11,096
But make it French fries instead
of that rice stuff, you know?

763
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:12,330
Okay.

764
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:14,001
I'm vegan.

765
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,734
Uh, just water.

766
00:43:16,736 --> 00:43:17,701
Okay.

767
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:20,906
I want the rice pilaf,
but no almonds. I can't.

768
00:43:20,908 --> 00:43:23,809
No almonds. [Bonnie]
And no salt in his.

769
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,746
And I would like a Rob Roy.

770
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:27,315
With cheese?

771
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,284
[stammers]

772
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:33,885
Never mind.
Okay.

773
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:35,956
I'm just gonna go
check in with the chef.

774
00:43:37,724 --> 00:43:39,891
I'm fine.
I don't need anything.

775
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:42,863
You guys, we gotta figure out a
faster way to get this license.

776
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:45,033
Not in this city.

777
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:48,734
Unless...
Unless what?

778
00:43:48,736 --> 00:43:51,037
Unless we go after
an existing license.

779
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,675
Make an offer to someone who has
a similar company in the past,

780
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:58,445
kept the license registered
but dormant.

781
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:03,083
Yes! That's...
Eduardo, you're a genius!

782
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:04,119
Thank you!

783
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:06,420
Huh?
Yes!

784
00:44:06,422 --> 00:44:08,990
No, thank you for the idea.
That's great.

1096
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:44,385
Why can't he cough
up the money, huh?

1097
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:46,022
I wish I could.

1098
01:00:48,858 --> 01:00:51,259
Dad.
[sighs]

1099
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:54,295
I'm so sorry, you
shouldn't have heard that.

1100
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:58,134
No, actually, I'm glad I did.

1101
01:00:59,303 --> 01:01:02,204
I should've told you two
the truth a long time ago.

1102
01:01:02,206 --> 01:01:03,971
About what?

1103
01:01:03,973 --> 01:01:07,074
About why I accepted
your offer to move in.

1104
01:01:07,076 --> 01:01:10,112
Why I'm not in some
luxurious country club,

1105
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:13,248
sippin' martinis,
playin' mini-golf.

1106
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,751
I'm broke.

1107
01:01:16,819 --> 01:01:17,818
What?

1108
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,189
Haven't got a dime to my name.

1109
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:22,224
You didn't have retirement
savings or investments?

1110
01:01:22,226 --> 01:01:25,428
Had both. Plenty of 'em.
Lost 'em all.

1111
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:29,033
How? I met a Nigerian
princess on the Internet,

1112
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:33,436
and she was tryin' to get her
family out of the country and...

1113
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:38,441
said she had millions and needed
a bank account in America.

1114
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:40,276
You fell for an Internet scam.

1115
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:45,951
See, she was so convincing
and... I was so lonely.

1116
01:01:47,085 --> 01:01:49,453
I guess after
your mother died,

1117
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:52,057
I just kinda lost my way a bit.

1118
01:01:53,058 --> 01:01:54,558
Did you call the police?

1119
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,362
How would it look?
An ex-con gets conned.

1120
01:01:58,364 --> 01:02:00,164
I was too embarrassed.

1121
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,432
Yeah, but you paid
for the license.

1122
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:05,068
That $2,000, where'd
you get that money from?

1123
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,073
My social security check.

1124
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:11,408
You gave up your social
security check to help me?

1125
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,345
Like I said, it was
the least I could do.

1126
01:02:14,347 --> 01:02:16,082
I should've told
you two sooner.

1127
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,919
I'm so sorry.

1128
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:39,373
What are you doin'? What's it
look like I'm doin'? I'm packin'.

1129
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,772
Where are you gonna go?

1130
01:02:41,774 --> 01:02:45,245
The last thing I wanna do is be
a burden on you and my daughter.

1131
01:02:45,946 --> 01:02:48,314
You're not a burden,
Eduardo, okay?

1132
01:02:48,316 --> 01:02:50,348
We like havin' you here.

1133
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,118
Do you know what
the penalty for perjury is?

1134
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,390
Man, stop playin'.
You're not goin' anywhere.

1135
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,025
What?

1136
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,061
Hold on.

1137
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,194
You got <i>The Pravda Protocol</i>
first edition?

1138
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,433
Yeah.
And <i>The Azerbaijan Accord.</i>

1139
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,567
You got
<i>The Moldavian Manuscripts.</i>

1140
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:11,270
What... and you got
<i>The Warsaw Wire?</i>

1141
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:12,874
Not one of your best titles.

1142
01:03:13,475 --> 01:03:16,309
Where'd you get these?
I bought 'em.

1143
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:18,177
You know I would've got
you some copies for free.

1144
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:20,447
Yeah, but I figured
if I paid for 'em,

1145
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:22,817
it would help
your sales figures, and...

1146
01:03:23,385 --> 01:03:29,255
I kinda like the idea of having a
son-in-law on the best-sellers' list.

1147
01:03:29,257 --> 01:03:31,625
Yeah? Even one that's not good
enough for your daughter?

1148
01:03:31,627 --> 01:03:33,562
All fathers say that.

1149
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:38,033
In your case, I was wrong.

1150
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:41,003
I'm really proud of you, Frank.

1151
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:45,575
And I'm proud to be
your father-in-law.

1152
01:03:50,512 --> 01:03:52,381
Does that mean
I could call you Dad?

1153
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,017
Don't push it.

1154
01:04:00,457 --> 01:04:02,457
Ah. Okay.

1155
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:05,992
Hey, so you think we can get
Granddaddy Day Care back on its feet?

1156
01:04:05,994 --> 01:04:08,963
You know, with you being a
writer and me being a lawyer,

1157
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:12,401
if we put our heads together,
I know we can come up with somethin'.

1158
01:04:12,403 --> 01:04:16,237
[indistinct]
These books are a mess.

1159
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:19,173
Who did your taxes,
anyway, a chimpanzee?

1160
01:04:19,175 --> 01:04:20,942
Is there anything
you can do for him, Walter?

1161
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:22,544
Well, of course I can.

1162
01:04:22,546 --> 01:04:26,280
I'm a CPA.
Certified Public Accountant.

1163
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,417
Now, the first thing we'll do

1164
01:04:28,419 --> 01:04:31,387
is to file for a tax extension.

1165
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:34,289
That'll give you
an extra 30 days.

1166
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:36,125
Thirty days?
Yeah.

1167
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:38,128
I can't come up with
all that money in 30 days.

1168
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:40,631
You won't have to.

1169
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,266
We're gonna sue the bastards.

If it may please the court,
the issue before us today

1174
01:05:28,347 --> 01:05:31,682
is not that of
a simple code violation,

1175
01:05:31,684 --> 01:05:36,353
but a larger Constitutional
right to free association

guaranteed us
by the First Amendment.

What do you think
of that, Frank?

1178
01:05:41,294 --> 01:05:43,127
Oh, that was
pretty good, man.

1179
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:44,763
But you might
wanna consider pants.

1180

Oh! Yeah. [laughs]

1181

Pants, no pants?

Nothing.

Yeah.

You know sometimes "nothing"
isn't really nothing.

I wasn't a good father to Emma

I just talked to your grandpa.

1196
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:50,731
Sorry I wasn't payin'
attention, man, you know?

1197
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:52,499
No big deal.
How was the audition?

1198
01:06:52,501 --> 01:06:53,734
Take a guess.

1199
01:06:53,736 --> 01:06:54,803
Ah...

1200
01:06:55,571 --> 01:06:58,372
I didn't even wanna be
in the stupid show.

1201
01:06:58,374 --> 01:07:00,508
And now Annie's gonna
find out I bombed,

1202
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,410
and she'll probably ignore me
for the rest of the year.

1203
01:07:03,412 --> 01:07:07,180
Or, maybe she'll
see what I see,

1204
01:07:07,182 --> 01:07:09,884
which is a very brave young
man who tried somethin' new.

You know how many books I had to write
before gettin' my first one published?

1208
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,493
I don't know.

1209
01:07:18,495 --> 01:07:20,228
Twenty-three.

- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1211
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,432
So, you know,
success and failures,

1212
01:07:24,434 --> 01:07:26,400
that's just two sides
of the same coin.

1213

You only really fail
at something

if you didn't give it a shot
in the first place, so...

Whatever happened,
just remember this.

1216
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:37,715
I'm always proud of you.
Always.

She was a wonderful woman.

She was always so polite.

Well, she might as well be.

01:09:30,364 --> 01:09:33,032
Okay, maybe parts of your body
are sagging like cheap luggage,

1250
01:09:33,034 --> 01:09:35,601
and so what, you need
to pee every 20 minutes.

1251
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:37,403
Ten.

1252
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:39,638
The point is,
your friend is in trouble,

1253
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,541
and if you don't help her,

1254
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:43,845
you're worse off than she is
in that nursin' home.

1255
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:47,315
You might as well
already be dead.

1256
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:52,687
My son-in-law is right.

1257
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:56,656
We can't just let that
wonderful woman rot in there

1258
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:59,762
because her stepdaughter
doesn't wanna deal with her.

1259
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,497
We've gotta do somethin'.

1260
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:04,699
I'm in.

1261
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,701
- We're in.
- We're in.

1262
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,671
- I'm in!
- All right, I'm in too.

1263
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,373
As long as you schedule
bathroom breaks.

1264
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,878
Look, I hate to be the
naysayer here, but, Dad?

1265
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,982
Did you forget you have
a court appointment tomorrow?

1266
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:24,988
You're supposed to be appearing before
the judge to save Granddaddy Day Care.

1267
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:30,390
You're right.
Something like this means

1268
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:34,431
breakin' into Blanche's
nursing home, finding her,

1269
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:39,268
avoiding the security guard,
getting her out of there,

1270
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,607
and makin' it to court
by 10:00 a.m.

1271
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:52,549
I'm in.

1272
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:58,654
[Big Lou] Okay, now, the
main entrance is right here.

1273
01:10:58,656 --> 01:11:02,524
We've got side entrances
here and here,

1274
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:04,960
but they're all locked
from the inside.

1275
01:11:04,962 --> 01:11:07,997
They've got security guards
24 hours a day.

1276
01:11:07,999 --> 01:11:11,935
They've got cameras in the
hallways recording everything.

1277
01:11:11,937 --> 01:11:16,472
The alarm system engages the moment
a resident steps off the property.

1278
01:11:16,474 --> 01:11:17,842
Well, it looks impossible.

1279
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:21,377
In 'Nam it was all
in a day's work.

1280
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:22,748
[Millie] Here.

1281
01:11:23,615 --> 01:11:27,016
I was gonna give these
to my grandkids for Christmas.

1282
01:11:27,018 --> 01:11:30,022
Last year
they gave me a fruitcake.

1283
01:11:30,989 --> 01:11:33,557
Screw 'em.

1284
01:11:33,559 --> 01:11:36,426
[Gabe] I don't know.
The place looks like Fort Knox.

1285
01:11:36,428 --> 01:11:38,695
You think they're gonna just
let us walk in the front door?

1286
01:11:38,697 --> 01:11:40,699
We're gonna have to be
very smart...

1287
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,969
and very, very inconspicuous.

1288
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:49,808
Yes. Whatever we do, we must
not call attention to ourselves.

1289
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:19,372
Please hold.

1290
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,505
May I help you?

1291
01:12:21,507 --> 01:12:23,942
Yes.
We're from 1-800-Clowns.

1292
01:12:23,944 --> 01:12:25,979
You ordered some
entertainment for today?

1293
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:31,183
There must be some mistake. I don't see
anything about this on our schedule.

1294
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:34,987
Better check again, lady. We didn't get
all dressed up like this for nothin'.

1295
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:36,956
What's wrong, Cujo?

1296
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,658
You smell a kitty-cat?
[barks]

1297
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,461
You can't go back there without a pass!
Come back here!

1298
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,163
[Millie barks]
Wait here.

1299
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:46,600
- [Big Lou] Don't you take her dog!
- Come back here!

1300
01:12:47,002 --> 01:12:48,503
You can't...

1301
01:12:49,004 --> 01:12:51,570
[Frank laughs]

1302
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:52,873
Let's go.

1303
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:04,052
Hmm. E-6.

1304
01:13:04,753 --> 01:13:05,787
Miss.

1305
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:08,855
[Gabe] Blanche Clark.
Room 113.

1306
01:13:08,857 --> 01:13:10,490
There you go, Gabe.
All right.

1307
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:11,959
You two,
keep security busy.

1308
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:14,029
Eduardo,
let's go get Blanche.

1309
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:20,069
Come back here!
Ooh!

1310
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:25,907
Security.
We have a situation.

1311
01:13:27,944 --> 01:13:30,945
I think Velma's been dippin'
into the pill stash again.

1312
01:13:30,947 --> 01:13:32,048
She said she saw
a bunch of clowns.

1313
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:35,818
Stay here.
I better check this out.

1314
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:39,789
What are you doin' here?

1315
01:13:40,122 --> 01:13:41,655
Huh?

1316
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:43,093
[grunting]

1317
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,235
There it is. 113.

1318
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,574
Wait, wait, look.

1319
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:01,945
[chuckles]

1320
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:06,815
Sal. We just lost another one.

1321
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,186
Sal!

1322
01:14:09,753 --> 01:14:11,856
Ah! Ah! Hey!

1323
01:14:20,298 --> 01:14:22,031
Blanche?

1324
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:23,833
It's me, Eduardo.

1325
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,869
We've come to get
you outta here.

1326
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,773
Ah!

1327
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,942
[both grunt]

1328
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:36,681
[phone ringing]

1329
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,023
[Gabe, high voice] <i>Front desk.</i>
Velma, call the cops.

1330
01:14:46,025 --> 01:14:47,991
The place is
crawlin' with clowns.

1331
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:49,761
Will do. [chuckles]

1332
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,698
B-Bozo to Emmett.
Come in, Emmett.

1333
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,869
Uh...
W-What's your 20? Over.

1334
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:00,938
Yeah, yeah, our "20" is that you
sent us to the wrong room, Gabe.

1335
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,672
Are you sure it says 113?

1336
01:15:02,674 --> 01:15:06,977
Uh... Oh, whoops.
[chuckles] It's 118. My bad.

1337
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:08,982
<i>I guess I do need glasses.</i>

1338
01:15:09,816 --> 01:15:11,315
[sighs] All right,
this better be the one,

1339
01:15:11,317 --> 01:15:13,817
because we have less than
an hour to get you to court.

1340
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:15,621
It's this way.
It's this way.

1341
01:15:26,199 --> 01:15:27,901
You're going down.

1342
01:15:29,836 --> 01:15:31,071
Excuse me.

1343
01:15:32,406 --> 01:15:34,739
You think Grandpa's
gonna make it here on time?

1344
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:38,142
Oh, he has to, honey. [clears
throat] Or we're in big trouble.

1345
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:39,913
All rise.

1346
01:15:47,288 --> 01:15:48,923
Let's see.

1347
01:15:50,056 --> 01:15:54,426
We have City Social Services
versus Frank Collins.

1348
01:15:54,428 --> 01:15:56,063
Approach the bench.

1349
01:15:57,698 --> 01:16:00,133
Um... Your Honor?
[chuckles]

1350
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:02,236
May I have a word with you?

1351
01:16:09,377 --> 01:16:10,777
Blanche!

1352
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:12,745
Eduardo! [gasps]

1353
01:16:12,747 --> 01:16:15,950
Eduardo! Oh!

1354
01:16:16,717 --> 01:16:18,218
How did you know it was me?

1355
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,920
I'd recognize
those eyes anywhere.

1356
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:22,989
[laughs] Okay, okay.
Pack up your stuff.

1357
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:24,391
We're gonna get you outta here.
Oh, okay.

1358
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:26,025
You don't have
to ask me twice. Oh!

1359
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:28,161
Hey, Emmett to Chuckles,
Emmett to Chuckles.

1360
01:16:28,163 --> 01:16:29,395
We're leavin'
the Big Top, baby.

1361
01:16:29,397 --> 01:16:30,799
What?

1362
01:16:31,234 --> 01:16:33,635
[radio beeps]
What's goin' on?

1363
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:48,450
Got you, and your
little invisible dog too.

1364
01:16:48,452 --> 01:16:49,386

Attention. Attention.</i>

Clowns!

1375
01:18:12,204 --> 01:18:15,005
We did it! [laughs]

1376
01:18:15,007 --> 01:18:18,308
We're not outta the woods yet. We
still don't have Big Lou and Bonnie.

1377
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,279
Let's go. Let's go.
Oh.

Hey, lady.
Oh!

1384
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,231
Easy.
[shrieks]

1385
01:18:40,233 --> 01:18:41,767

There they are!

1389
01:18:52,078 --> 01:18:53,246
Ah!

1390
01:18:58,185 --> 01:19:00,221
No man left behind!

There's definitely a better route.
I know, I know.

1393
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:24,411
You're driving too fast. You could
look at Google or Waze or something.

1394
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:26,011
What are you talkin' about?

1395
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:28,417
[sound becomes muffled]

1396
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:32,218
Your Honor,
with all due respect,

1397
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,289
are we really gonna
wait for them all day?

1398
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:40,560
That's it. I'm calling it.
The court rules in favor of...

1399

Your Honor,
I was unavoidably detained.

1400
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:48,969
Well, I imagine you have a really
good explanation, Mr. Hernandez.

1401
01:19:48,971 --> 01:19:50,337
I certainly do, Your Honor.

1402
01:19:50,339 --> 01:19:52,238
Are you ready to proceed?

1403
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,009
Yes, Your Honor.
I am.

1404
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:03,284
Eduardo Hernandez for the
petitioner, Mr. Frank Collins.

1405
01:20:03,286 --> 01:20:08,055
This case is a perfect example
of regulatory overreach.

1406
01:20:08,057 --> 01:20:10,625
This seems to me that
your client was operating

1407
01:20:10,627 --> 01:20:14,931
an illegal elder day care facility
and got caught with his pants down.

1408
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,202
No, that's not what...

1409
01:20:21,037 --> 01:20:22,437
Uh...

1410
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:24,506
No, that's not what...

1411
01:20:24,508 --> 01:20:28,976
It was like more of a...
Where is...

1412
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:31,446
Wait a minute.
It was a... What...

1413
01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:33,515
Mr. Hernandez,
are you all right?

1414
01:20:33,517 --> 01:20:36,552
Wait a minute.
Hold... No!

1415
01:20:36,554 --> 01:20:39,521
He... It was more of a...

1416
01:20:39,523 --> 01:20:41,256
Grandpa's losing it.
What was I sayin'?

1417
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:44,059
Uh... Your Honor, it's...

1418
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:45,062
Hey, hey, hey.

1419
01:20:46,398 --> 01:20:48,398
The regulations
are overreaching.

1420
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,601
- Who the hell are you?
- Dad?

1421
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:54,202
Mr. Collins, I'm afraid we're
gonna have to put an end to this.

1422
01:20:54,204 --> 01:20:56,339
No, no, please, Your Honor. Just
give us a minute. He'll be okay.

1423
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:58,141
Hey, Eduardo.
Look at me. Look at me.

1424
01:20:58,143 --> 01:21:00,143
Where are we?
We're in court.

1425
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:02,177
Everybody is here waitin'
to hear you tell 'em about

1426
01:21:02,179 --> 01:21:04,282
how you argued in front
of Judge Hightower.

1427
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:06,684
Judge Hightower.

1428
01:21:14,592 --> 01:21:17,393
Class A moron.

1429
01:21:17,395 --> 01:21:19,463
[chuckles]
[judge clears throat]

1430
01:21:19,465 --> 01:21:21,567
What does that
have to do with this?

1431
01:21:40,419 --> 01:21:42,722
Your Honor, it's true.

1432
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:48,193
We used a 102-C license

1433
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:51,696
to run a 105-D facility.

1434
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:55,533
It's also true that
we have not yet complied

1435
01:21:55,535 --> 01:22:00,575
with the code requirements
of a 105-D facility.

1436
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:05,811
But neither of these
are the real point.

1437
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:10,816
The real point is that this
capricious and vindictive fine

1438
01:22:10,818 --> 01:22:16,187
goes to the very heart of our
right for freedom of association.

1439
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:20,159
It was done without
notice or warning.

1440
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:24,698
And more importantly, it violates our
right to remedy the transgressions.

1441
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:28,167
It's unconstitutional
and un-American.

1442
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:31,470
And that's why only
a class A moron

1443
01:22:31,472 --> 01:22:33,540
could try to get away
with something like this.

1444
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:35,809
Your Honor! I-I object!

1445
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:39,080
You can't object.
Your lawyer has to object.

1446
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:42,214
Save your breath.
Overruled.

1447
01:22:42,216 --> 01:22:46,753
Now, Mr. Tooley, when did you
cite Mr. Collins' facility?

1448
01:22:46,755 --> 01:22:49,121
On the fifth, Your Honor.

1449
01:22:49,123 --> 01:22:52,526
Now, you didn't
inspect the premises

1450
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:54,496
prior to issuing the citation?

1451
01:22:55,831 --> 01:23:00,768
No! Well, we didn't have a warrant
to enter the premises, so...

1452
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,869
So he had no notice
of the violations?

1453
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:05,405
Mm, well, we visited
Mr. Collins' facility

1454
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:07,407
on a number of occasions...

1455
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:09,175
But he did
not have the chance

1456
01:23:09,177 --> 01:23:12,148
to rectify any transgressions
prior to the fine.

1457
01:23:12,649 --> 01:23:15,549
He had plenty of time
to comply.

1458
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:17,785
Plenty of time to comply.
Thank you, Mr. Tooley.

1459
01:23:17,787 --> 01:23:20,223
But... But...
Thank you.

1460
01:23:22,325 --> 01:23:25,860
Your Honor, if it may
please the court,

1461
01:23:25,862 --> 01:23:30,498
all these people here have come
to support Granddaddy Day Care.

1462
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,901
Do you think they all
would've come this far

1463
01:23:32,903 --> 01:23:37,371
if they didn't really believe
in what my son-in-law was doing?

1464
01:23:37,373 --> 01:23:40,141
Yeah, he bent a few rules,

1465
01:23:40,143 --> 01:23:43,378
but he opened his house
to some senior citizens

1466
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:46,448
so that they could
have some fun,

1467
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,152
enjoy each other's company,
and maybe, for a change,

1468
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,287
feel valued.

1469
01:23:52,556 --> 01:23:54,625
And in the end, Your Honor,

1470
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:58,162
isn't that what
we all really want?

1471
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:08,871
You know, none of us
are getting any younger.

1472
01:24:08,873 --> 01:24:12,208
Now, Mr. Collins, you
probably broke a few rules,

1473
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,311
but your heart is
in the right place.

1474
01:24:15,547 --> 01:24:18,514
The $50,000 fine
is hereby vacated.

1475
01:24:18,516 --> 01:24:21,551
- [gasping, exclaiming]
- Your Honor...

1476
01:24:21,553 --> 01:24:25,590
But, Mr. Collins, I will not
let you ignore the regulations.

1477
01:24:26,658 --> 01:24:29,561
You have 90 days to bring
your facility up to code.

1478
01:24:30,228 --> 01:24:31,596
Thank you, Your Honor.

1479
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:35,635
And, Mr. Hernandez?

1480
01:24:36,935 --> 01:24:38,203
Yes, Your Honor?

1481
01:24:39,939 --> 01:24:42,906
It's good to see you on that
side of the courtroom, Eduardo.

1482
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:45,211
[chuckles]
Thank you, Bill.

1483
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:48,312
I find for the plaintiff.

1484
01:24:48,314 --> 01:24:49,915
[cheering]

1485
01:24:56,322 --> 01:24:58,255
You did it, Eduardo.
Thank you.

1486
01:24:58,257 --> 01:25:00,358
Why don't we cut that
"Eduardo" stuff out, okay?

1487
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,792
Okay. Eddie?

1488
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:05,329
Ah, why don't we try "Dad"?

1489
01:25:05,331 --> 01:25:06,767
Let's try it!

1490
01:25:10,637 --> 01:25:12,774
I am so proud of you.

1491
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:14,507
Oh!

1492
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:22,617
There he is!

1493
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:28,353
How dare you take my stepmother
out of her nursing home?

1494
01:25:28,355 --> 01:25:31,791
And how dare you not abide
by your stepmother's wishes?

1495
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,493
Who the hell are you? I'm
your stepmother's attorney.

1496
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:36,362
And the first thing
we're going to do

1497
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:39,330
is contest her
late husband's will.

1498
01:25:39,332 --> 01:25:42,401
Well, there's no reason
to reopen probate.

1499
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:45,271
Yeah, we don't need
no lawyer gettin' involved.

1500
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,739
Okay, good.

1501
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:50,042
Why don't we ask your mother
what her wishes are?

1502
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,412
Of course.

1503
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:54,815
Mom, where do you wanna live?

1504
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:58,286
I want to live in my house.

1505
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:01,921
Of course.
Whatever you want, Mom.

1506
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:03,924
We just wanna
make you happy.

1507
01:26:03,926 --> 01:26:05,892
[Eduardo]
Oh, good, good.

1508
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,628
Why don't I draw up some
paperwork to make it formal?

1509
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,064
Not that I don't trust you...

1510
01:26:10,066 --> 01:26:11,700
but I don't.

1511
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:15,971
Let's go.

1512
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:18,741
Good!

1513
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:20,977
Good.

1514
01:26:24,414 --> 01:26:25,912
I'm gonna party.

1515
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,016
Of course he is.

1516
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,520
So, now what?

1517
01:26:32,522 --> 01:26:35,090
You heard the judge.
We've got work to do.

1518
01:26:35,092 --> 01:26:37,959
Hmm.

Five.
Yeah. Nice.

1521
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:55,443
Have you ever blown up
a full-size van?

1522
01:26:55,445 --> 01:26:57,579
No. No.
What'd you say?

1523
01:26:57,581 --> 01:26:59,782
I said, "No."
I work with computers.

1524
01:26:59,784 --> 01:27:01,616
Computers, man.
What're you sayin'?

1525
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:02,887
No!

1526
01:27:06,924 --> 01:27:09,525
Nice turn out.
Yeah, huh?

1527
01:27:09,527 --> 01:27:11,027
Listen,

1528
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:13,296
I've been thinkin' about
what you said before...

1529
01:27:14,665 --> 01:27:16,999
about goin' to see a doctor?
Mm-hmm.

1530
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:19,737
Why don't we make
an appointment for next week?

1531
01:27:20,772 --> 01:27:22,741
Okay. Great.

1532
01:27:23,942 --> 01:27:26,441
What brought on
this change of heart?

1533
01:27:26,443 --> 01:27:29,679
Uh... Let's say I just
got a lot goin' on,

1534
01:27:29,681 --> 01:27:32,115
and I don't wanna
miss a thing.

1535
01:27:32,117 --> 01:27:34,953
[chuckles] Yeah.

1536
01:27:38,156 --> 01:27:39,825
[sighs]

1537
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:51,670
Hi, Jordan.

1538
01:27:52,504 --> 01:27:55,405
Hey, Annie.
What are you doin' here?

1539
01:27:55,407 --> 01:27:57,510
I came with my grandparents.

1540
01:27:58,444 --> 01:28:00,477
I heard about
your audition.

1541
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:02,081
Sorry.

1542
01:28:03,481 --> 01:28:06,650
I didn't really wanna be
in the show anyways.

1543
01:28:06,652 --> 01:28:07,887
So, why'd you do it?

1544
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:10,989
I thought that
if I was in the show,

1545
01:28:10,991 --> 01:28:12,792
we'd get to hang out together.

1546
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:17,595
Jordan, you didn't have to
audition to hang out with me.

1547
01:28:17,597 --> 01:28:20,868
I've wanted to talk to you since
I first saw you in physics class.

1548
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:24,768
Really?
Really.

1549
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:27,705
Hey, since I never got
to see your audition,

1550
01:28:27,707 --> 01:28:30,876
could you maybe sing
your song for me sometime?

1551
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:32,746
Anytime.

1552

01:29:03,778 --> 01:29:05,611
I don't know about that.

1559
01:29:05,613 --> 01:29:06,846
What do you mean?

1560
01:29:06,848 --> 01:29:10,583
Well, I mean, maybe Jack
Quartermaine has had his day.

1561
01:29:10,585 --> 01:29:14,220
Maybe it's time for me to write
about somethin' new, you know?

1562
01:29:14,222 --> 01:29:17,859
Yeah.
Somethin' fresh and...

1563
01:29:21,096 --> 01:29:22,498
original.

1564
01:29:29,772 --> 01:29:31,674
Boom!
[mimics explosion]

1565
01:29:35,711 --> 01:29:37,512
[whispers]
Hold my drink.

1566
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,516
[sighs]

1567
01:29:42,518 --> 01:29:43,786
Well...

1568
01:30:18,189 --> 01:30:21,859
[all screaming]

1569
01:30:24,928 --> 01:30:26,661
We're trapped!

1570
01:30:26,663 --> 01:30:28,330
What are we gonna do?

1571
01:30:28,332 --> 01:30:31,967
What else do we do
when we come to a dead end?

1572
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:33,669
We bust right through!

1573
01:30:33,671 --> 01:30:35,071
[all shouting]

1574
01:30:35,073 --> 01:30:37,842
["Wild" by The Phantoms playing]

1575
01:30:45,117 --> 01:30:47,119
[no audible dialogue]

1576
01:30:54,755 --> 01:30:59,755
Subtitles by explosiveskull

1577
01:32:56,453 --> 01:32:58,421
[song ends]
