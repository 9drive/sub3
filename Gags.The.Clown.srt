There's an evil clown roaming
the streets of Green Bay.

This frightening video
and many other images

of a mysterious person
in a dingy clown suit

roaming the streets
with black balloons

00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:54,598
have been flooding
social media all week.

While police and city officials are still determining

98
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,256
the proper recourse for
this bizarre situation,

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,259
we sent WGRB's
very own Heather Duprey

out on location

Thanks, Tom.

104
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,356
I'm standing under
the Mason Bridge,

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,358
a quiet little area
in downtown Green Bay

106
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:18,753
that no one ever paid
attention to...until now.

107
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:21,233
As you can see, there's
a frenzy of action behind me,

108
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,235
as people gather hoping
to catch a glimpse

109
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,326
of Green Bay's very
own Gags the Clown.

110
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,590
It was here that the clown was first spotted one week ago.

111
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,201
A passerby stopped to take pictures in awe of what he saw

112
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,377
and posted them
on social media.

113
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,074
The pictures
quickly went viral,

114
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,859
intriguing millions
around the world.

115
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,427
But some are suspicious
about the clown's intentions.

116
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,038
While some find it to be
harmless, good-natured fun,

117
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,388
others are troubled,
even frightened,

118
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,172
and wish that whoever
was responsible

119
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,827
would quit
their clowning around.

120
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,438
The last thing
I need to worry about

121
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,875
is some unstable person
dressed in a clown suit.

122
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,485
I mean, how is
this not illegal?

123
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,140
Children are scared,
parents are scared.

124
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,664
Heck, I'm scared.

125
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,100
What are people
really scared of,

126
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,711

from outer space?

127
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:04,929
Come on.

128
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,714
It's just a guy looking
to have some fun

129
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,019
and I'm all for it.

130
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:09,847
Now, as reported
earlier this week,

131
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,372
the Green Bay Police Department has issued a statement saying

132
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,199
that they will not be
pursuing this individual

133
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:15,810
unless they have
reason to believe

134
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,855
that he or she
has broken the law.

135
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,292
However, due to the commotion
that Gags the Clown

136
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,555
has created,
the police department

137
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,252
will be increasing its patrols

138
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,776
and questioning anyone
for suspicious behavior.

139
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,430
If you or anyone you know

140
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,910
has seen this individual

141
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:31,042
or any other individual
dressed like a clown,

142
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,304
you are instructed

143
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:33,784
to call the police
department immediately.

144
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,439

wherever you are, Gags!

on the Green Bay
clown's actions,

148
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,447
it's safe to say that he or she has this city's attention.

00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,123
[Tyler] Last time I'm gonna
tell you this, dude.

158
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,125
You gotta wait outside
for 30 minutes.

159
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:13,258
No one's gonna expect
when it happens,

160
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,391
but you gotta trust me on this.

161
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,871
-Hey, it's Heather Duprey.
-[Chris] What?

162
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,438
[Sara] From Channel Nine.

163
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,222
[gasping] I bet they're
looking for Gags.

164
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,094
She is so pretty.

165
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,096
I'd totally bang her.

166

[Sara scoffing]

167
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,665
What?
I totally would.

168
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,146
Hey, what about you, Gags?

169
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,191
You wanna bang
the hot news lady?

170
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,587
Gags horny.
Gags wants bang hot news lady.

171
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,589
[both laughing]

172
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,939
[Sara] Why does Gags
sound like a Neanderthal?

173
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,332
A what?

174
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,467
Those original Gags
photos are just creepy.

175
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,946
You're still looking at them?

176
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,295
I mean, I don't
wanna look at them,

177
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,297
but you know...

178
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:56,171
No, I don't.
Then just don't. Heh.
Pretty simple.

179
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,608
You know when something's
really scary or creepy

180
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,610
and you just can't
stop looking at it?

181
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,394
That's how I feel about
those Gags photos.

182
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,092
Yeah, no, that's
your problem, not mine.

183
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,573
-That obviously is my problem.
-[police radio chatter]

184
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,575
I just was hoping
that you're my partner

185
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,490
and I can confide it with you.

186
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:14,058
I guess this clown situation
has you really emotional, huh?

187
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:17,888
You know, uh, yeah.

[rock music playing

189
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,719
As you just heard,
I am Charles Wright

190
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,547
and this is
the Wright Stuff Podcast,

191
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,549
coming at you live
every Saturday night

192
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,116
for your listening pleasure.

193
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:31,075
I almost hate to do it,

194
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,383
because I'm so damn sick
of hearing about it myself,

195
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:36,428
but tonight's topic is
something that's really

196
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,518
been bothering me as of late.

197
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:41,216
As most of you know, I'm
a Wisconsin boy, born and bred,

198
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,958
currently residing in the
beautiful city of Green Bay.

199
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,221
It's small, it's quaint,

200
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:48,310
and for the most part peaceful.

201
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:52,532
But earlier this week,
we had an unwanted visitor.

202
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,883
And his arrival has me
pissed to say the least.

203
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,323
That's right, a clown.

204
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:03,238
A goddamn clown.

205
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,588
Gags the Clown, to be exact,

206
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,329
because somebody thought
it'd be a good idea

207
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,592
to name the bastard.

208
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,594
Can anybody tell me
what kind of person

209
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,162
dresses up in big floppy
shoes and a red nose

210
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,251
and walks around
at two o'clock in the morning?

211
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,905
I mean, we're not
just talking about

212
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,820
some drunk kid from
the house party down the road

213
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:23,301
who lost a bet and ran around
in a Halloween costume.

214
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:27,088
This guy, he put
some thought into this,

215
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,265
with the sole intent of
terrifying people to death.

216
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,136
And what's worse,
he keeps doing it.

217
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,096
He keeps going out
and being seen.

218
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,576
I'm thinking
this wacko is getting off

219
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,708
on terrifying
my city half to death,

220
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,102
and I, for one,
have had enough of it.

they could take her home now.

cut off that fled the scene,

and a witness
whose boyfriend is now MIA.

Wait, his face was cut off?

Unit 1-12, response
to 237 Courtland

abduction involving a clown.

Of course.

This was eight days ago.

and about a million
unconfirmed sightings

and what I wanna know is,

305
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,010
why are people
grabbing their phones

and taking pictures of him?

Like I said, I'd be
grabbing something else.

don't these people realize

00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,813
and look for
the same amount of attention.

316
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,903
Don't even get me
started on the GBPD.

317
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,557
I mean, look,
I have endless respect

318
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,646
for our men and women
behind the badge

319
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,648
going out there
every single day,

320
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,955
putting their lives on the line
to protect and serve,

321
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,306
but they have dropped the ball
in a big way this week.

322
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,526
I mean, we have
a individual essentially

323
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,310
terrorizing the city.

324
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,269
People are afraid
to go out at night.

325
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:56,661
Parents are afraid
to have their kids

326
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,185
walking home from school.

327
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,752
I mean, the city is
essentially under attack,

328
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:03,886
and yet, the cops say there's
nothing they can do about it.

329
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,846
"Dressing like a clown
isn't illegal."

330
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,978
Well, what about disturbing
the fucking peace?

331
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,894
'Cause last time I checked,
that was still illegal.

332
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,853
Is that true, Eddie?

333
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,724
Did you see a clown
who offered you candy

334
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,553
in exchange for you coming
into the woods with him?

335
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:19,641
Can't remember.

336
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:23,601
Eddie.

337
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,736
You know it's a crime
to lie to the police.

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,652
-[Mom] Now, wait a minute.
-Lori saw him, not me.

339
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:31,914
I never even saw him.

It's okay, we're done
here, Eddie, thank you.

342
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:43,752
Ma'am, it is very important
when making a report

343
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,972
to the police that you
gather all the facts first.

344
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,192
Facts?
You know he's up to no good.

345
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,802
And stop giving me that,

346
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:53,022
"It's not illegal
to dress creepy" bullshit.

347
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,894
Watch your language, ma'am.

348
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,330
And have a good night.

I'm not playing games!

Picked a hell of a topic
for tonight's show, boy.

371
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,774
Comments are flowing
like the Schplatz Light.

372
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,690
-Ah-ha.
-Laura from Green Bay says,

373
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,779
"My 15-year-old
daughter is begging me

374
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,259
to let her
and her friends go out

375
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,087
and try and find him,
but I refused.

376
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,958
There's something
not right about him.

377
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,656
This isn't someone having
fun at the expense of others.

378
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,180
This is a sick individual."

379
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,182
Hey, I couldn't
agree more, Laura.

380
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,140
Let me just say this.

381
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,968
If dressing up like a clown

382
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,796
and walking around
the city at night

383
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,406
is your idea of entertainment,

384
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,842
you need to get
your fucking head checked

385
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,322
because something ain't right.

386
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,802
Hey, hey, hey, check out
this comment by Larry Robinson.

387
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,325
It's what we were
talking about last night.

388
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:04,458
All right, all right,
uh, let me find it.

389
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,764
Okay, here we go.

390
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,854
Oh-ho. "We'd love to see you
go out and find him.

391
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,856
Do what the cops
are too afraid to do

392
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,337
and put a stop
to this nonsense."

393
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:16,209
Thanks for the comment, Larry.

394
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,081
Oh, shit, it's a popular
one too, 14 likes already

395
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,214
in just two minutes.

396
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:25,174
Hey, trust me, folks, it's
been discussed long and hard.

397
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,002
You know, at first,
I just shrugged it off,

398
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,482
'cause I figured, you know,
our law enforcement's

399
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,049
gonna take care of it.

400
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,528
But eight days past
the point, I'm wondering

401
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,703
if maybe that's
what needs to be done,

402
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,227
a little vigilante justice.

403
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,012
I mean, we are the laughing
stock of the country right now.

404
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,666
The whole city's
in a state of panic

405
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,102
over a goddamn clown?

406
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,105
Hey, what do you all think?

407
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,889
I mean, is that
the popular opinion out there?

408
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,240
Should Charles Wright
go clown hunting?

409
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,720
Let us know on the page.

410
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,114
Better yet,
share this video.

411
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:56,379
I tell you what, if we get
500 shares, it's a done deal.

412
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:59,121
I will go out and I will hit
the streets of Green Bay

413
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,949
and I will find
this clown tonight.

414
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,821
So if you wanna see that
happen, share the video.

This is Charles Wright
of the Wright Stuff Podcast.

447
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,586
And on tonight's episode,
we asked our fans

448
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,458
if they would like me to go out

449
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,025
and find this clown that's
been causing all this ruckus.

450
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,984
But there was one stipulation.

451
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,552
Our clown huntin' wouldn't
begin until we had reached

452
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,902
over 500 shares.

453
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,818
Well, last time we checked,
we had over 800,

454
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,820
so we took it
as a big fucking yes

455
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,865
that was heard loud and clear.

456
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,868
So, we're gonna hit
the streets tonight,

Stuff special episode.

00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:27,965
If he is just
a fucking crackhead,

461
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,490
he's done very well for himself.

-The guy dressed up

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,941
as a squirrel mascot,
turned out to be a crackhead.

468

It's the same thing.

469
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,031
Great, but that is like

470

if you're going
to be a crackhead

and you have x amount

00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,472
and you chose the one

473
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,344
that you're going
to create a character--

474
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,084
I hate when
you play devil's advocate.

475
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:02,086
It's so obnoxious.

476
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,308
I, for real,
find this guy heroic.

477
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,962
-Heroic?
-Heroic.

478
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,877
I think that you use words

479
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,183
and you don't entirely know
what they mean.

480
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:16,318
[dispatcher] I need a unit
at 1647 Division Street.

481
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,972
Underage drinking party.

482
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:20,322
We have clowns reported
on site, please advise.

483
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,237
Should we take that call?

484
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,934
Now look, here's the deal.

485
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,284
If we find this guy--

486
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,329
[Wayne] Uh-uh,
when we find him.

487
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,461
Thank you, Wayne.

488
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,680
When we find this guy,

489
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,727
I'm simply gonna ask him
to take his goofy ass home

490
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,295
and stop this nonsense
once and for all.

491
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,906
And I will do
my goddamn best to be civil.

492
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,516
I really will.

493
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,997
But after that,
the ball's in his court.

494
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,652
And if he comes
at me, pulls anything,

495
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:49,177
or even says something
so stupid that I get pissed off,

496
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,311
he's gonna say hi
to old Audrey here.

497
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,008
[Wayne] Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

498
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,575
See, old Audrey and I

499
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,968
did a few tours
together overseas.

500
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,840
Had a few dates
on the front line,

501
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,363
got along real good,

502
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,191
and she put out
from the get go.

503
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,889
[Wayne] Yeah, put a few
towelheads out of their misery.

504
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,371
Oh, trust me, there was more
than just a few. [chuckling]

505
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,025
I'm just kidding.

506
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,593
Much as I love to let
old Audrey tag along,

507
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,204
I'm thinking I'll need
to be a little more discreet.

508
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,511
That's where Gwen comes in.

509
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:21,122
See she's simple, dependable,

510
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,907
always has dinner ready,
never lets me down.

511
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:31,175
You know what, I might
even bring along big Marge.

512
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,525
She's been cooped up
for a while,

513
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:35,310
been itching to powder up.

514
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,356
One blast from old Marge,

515
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:41,011
that clown's gonna pop like
one of those black balloons.

516
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:43,927
Be nothing left
but his big ole shoes.

517
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:49,019
My life's work is jeopardized
by these scary clowns.

518
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,369
[sobbing]

519
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:56,505
I'm sorry, I didn't think
that I'd get this emotional.

520
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,118
It's okay, you're doing good.

521
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:06,863
I just, I love being a clown,

522
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:13,957
and it feels like the whole
world is either scared of me

523
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:17,178
or hates me right now.

524
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,920
Oh, careful,
your makeup's gonna run.

525
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,530
[crowd chattering]

526
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,229
Sara?

527
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:27,884
-What are you doing?
-[Sara] Nothing.

528
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,582
Sara.

529
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,279
-[Sara] What?
-Don't be like that.

530
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,977
-[Sara] Don't be like what?
-Don't do this.

531
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,066
-Dude, dude.
-Hey, what's up?

532
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,199
Drew is upstairs.

533
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:41,768
-Okay?
-With Anna Novotny.

534
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:48,731
[Sara chuckling]
They're gonna hate you.

535
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,650
-The fuck?
-Jesus Christ!

536
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:56,478
Oh, Drew!
I'm gonna make you--

537
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:59,655
Get the fuck off of me!
The hell is the matter with you?

538
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,962
-[Anna] Get out, Chris!
-[Sara] We gotta hit, cops!

539
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,094
[Sara] Crap, Chris, Chris, stop
screwing around, we gotta go!

540
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,708
[people clamoring]

541
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,060
[Sara]
Chris, really?

542
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,714
Really, just gonna
leave without Tyler?

543
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,544
I can't get busted, I can't
get busted, I can't get busted.

544
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,938
[Jake] Hey!
Stop right there.

545
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:24,114
I don't think so.

546
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,725
[Chrissy on radio]
What's your 20? Over.

547
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:28,205
[Jake] I'm in the alley behind
the 1600 block of Division.

548
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:29,555
Just apprehended one, over.

549
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:34,211
So, your night's about
to get interesting, huh?

550
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,171
[Chrissy] You've
got to be kidding me.

551
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,651
[Jake] Hope the party
was worth it.

552
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,526
[Sara] Of course
you're working tonight.

553
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,745
I'm sorry, I...

554
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,660
Jake, meet my daughter Sara.

555
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,488
Stepdaughter.

556
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,012
Oh, so you're Sara.

557
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:56,233
Nice to finally meet you.

558
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:57,844
Likewise.

559
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,281
-[Chrissy] You been drinking?
-No.

560
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:02,892
-Don't lie to me.
-I'm not.

561
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,286
Give me a breathalyzer
if you don't believe me.

562
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,375
This is awkward.

563
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:10,030
[Chrissy] Thank you,
Jake, I got it.

564
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:12,032
I'm gonna go sweep the house.

565
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,387
[Chrissy]
Look at me. Look at me.

566
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,434
-Who were you with tonight?
-Friends.

567
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,959
-[Chrissy] What friends?
-I don't know, a few.

568
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,613
Cut the shit, who?

569
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,310
Am I in trouble,
Officer Renard?

570
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:30,572
Or can I go now?

571
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:33,314
[Chrissy] Okay,
drop the attitude, Sara.

572
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,229
I am really sick
and tired of this.

573
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,796
You know, you can't just use me

574
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,015
as a get out of jail
free card, okay?

575
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,582
[Sara] I didn't drink.

576
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,931
[Chrissy]
Okay, where's your car?

577
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,411
[Sara] It's at Chris's.

578
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,282
Okay, I want you to go
directly to Chris's house,

579
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:47,067
get your car and drive home.

580
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,635
I'm calling your father
in an hour

581
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,811
and he better tell me
you're in for the night.

582
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,247
No, it's Saturday night!

583
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,641
I don't care, Sara,
I want you home!

584
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,991
You know, matter of fact,

585
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,341
get in my squad car,
I'll take you home myself.

586
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,865
[scoffs]
No, I will go home on my own.

587
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,214
I'm serious, Sara.

588
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,738
Yeah, I know, me too.

589
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,526
[Chrissy] Okay, I want you
to go straight home!

590
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,963
10-4.

591
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,661
[Chrissy]
You don't run from cops!

592
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,011
Damn brat.

593
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:23,886
Gee, Miss Duprey, you really
are much prettier in person

594
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,496
than you are on TV.

595
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,369
Oh, thanks.

596
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:35,594
[Dale] All right,
in five, four, three...

597
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,686
Thanks, Tom and Alison.

598
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,688
I'm standing here
with Ralph Jungwirth,

599
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:45,908
business owner of Somewhere In Time Antiques on Cedar Street

600
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,563
and lifelong resident
of Green Bay.

601
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,260
Ralph here claims
to have seen the person

602
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,263
that everyone in Green Bay,
not to mention the world,

603
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,656
has been talking about.

604
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,136
Ralph, what can
you tell us about

605
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,442
your Gags the Clown sighting?

606
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:03,273
Well, ahem,
it happens every day

607
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:05,624
when I walk through my store,

608
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,930
I see this!

609
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:12,979
Ah, excuse me.

610
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,374
Are you saying
that you didn't see the clown

611
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,507
that everyone has
been talking about

612
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,944
this past week?

613
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:24,294
Well, not exactly.

614
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:28,124
But I mean, I saw
all the photos on the news.

615
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:30,213
[chuckles]
Everyone has.

616
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:34,348
But I recognized him
immediately.

617
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:38,134
The outfit, the face paint.

618
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:43,531
Now, this picture is
from 1974.

619
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:49,537
It was taken at the Bowers and Marsh Big Top Family Circus

620
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,932
that set up shop
every summer in Green Bay

621
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:56,500
for 20 plus years prior,

622
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,202
right up until that August
when it all went up in smoke.

623
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:06,032
I've got tons of their
old stuffs in this store.

624
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:10,297
Salvaged everything I could
after that fire, and I'll--

625
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,734
Sir, you mean to tell me
that you are not referring

626
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,649
to the clown that everyone's
been talking about,

627
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,697
but rather a different
clown from 1974?

628
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,917
Look!

629
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,224
It's the same one.

630
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,707
Well, there you have it.

631
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,318
Has Gags the Clown
been wandering the streets

632
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:35,235
of Green Bay since 1974 and
no one's noticed until now?

633
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,716
We'll have more on this story and many more exciting updates

634
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,588
as we continue
our WGRB Gags coverage.

635
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:44,592
For WGRB, I'm Heather Duprey,
stay tuned.

And the live feed is cut.

637
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:47,813
What?

638
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,553
We're done, that's it?

639
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:50,772
Yeah, we're done.

640
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,863
Eh, okay.

641
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:58,171
Thank you for making me
come all the way down

642
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,521
to my shop this late at night

643
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,436
for a piddly little interview!

644
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,351
No, thank you

645
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:07,093
for that wonderful breaking news
from 1974.

646
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,617
Get out of my store!

647
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,011
Maybe the competition
will believe me,

648
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,143
you pixie whore.

649
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:17,451
[Dale laughing]

650
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,975
Oh, my God!

651
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,760
[Dale] You kind
of did deserve that.

652
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:25,198
Pack up your shit, let's go.

653
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,245
Oh, shut the fuck--

654
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,681
-Oh, look who it is.
-Oh, jeez.

of WBSC, reporting live

656

on scene where
we have Heather Duprey

657
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:41,736
of the struggling WGRB.

658
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,477
Now, can you tell me,
Miss Duprey,

659
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,568
what does it feel like
to be the sole ambassador

660
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:50,049
of Gags Watch?

661
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:54,053
-Just stop.
-Hmm, "Just stop."

662
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:56,359
Well, you heard it
here first, folks.

663
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,666
Heather Duprey,
first on the beat

664
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,712
is going to, well, stop.

665
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,018
Details at 10.

666
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:05,020
Hmm, typical
Channel 3, coming here

667
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,761
for my sloppy seconds.

668
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,025
Damn girl, clearly
someone can't handle

669
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,810
a little friendly rivalry?

670
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,115
Oh, could this night
get any worse?

671
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,422
I feel like
my head is gonna blow.

672
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,858
Make sure
you're rolling, Cody.

673
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,164
Wouldn't wanna miss this.

674
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:20,644
Ah, okay, okay.

675
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,125
Calm down, we'll let you be.

676
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,648
Good luck tonight.

677
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,389
Make sure to keep
that positive attitude

678
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,782
of yours going strong.

679
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:31,220
-Bye, Dale.
-Bye, Bec.

680
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,179
-Later, Cody.
-[Cody] Later, man.

681
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,355
-What was that?
-What was what?

682
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:37,009
Bye, Dale.
Oh, bye, Bec.

683
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:39,489
-Later, Cody.
-Oh, come on.

684
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:42,275
Wait, are you
and Miss WBSC fuck--

685
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:44,843
Yes, I heard that, so game on.

686
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,890
[Chris] Hey,
look who showed up.

687
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,152
Oh, yeah,
and we were starting to think

688
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,067
you got booked by your mom--

689
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:54,548
-Thanks for waiting on me.
-Uh-huh?

690
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,984
Yeah, I could have
bolted a lot sooner

691
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,507
when the cops showed.

692
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,900
I was looking for you.

693
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,684
Come on, you don't
have to worry about me.

694
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,121
[Chris] Yeah, and we were
pretty sure your mom

695
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,687
would just bail you out again.

696
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,385
All right, it's stepmom.

697
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,777
You know,
and speaking of which,

698
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:08,736
she is fucking hot
in that uniform.

699
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,913
I mean, your dad must love 'em
young and exotic.

700
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,654
Tyler, shut up.

701
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,438
Just take me to my car.

702
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,266
Yeah, Sara,
it's not even nine o'clock,

703
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,833
you can't go home yet.

704
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,183
What, this party's busted.

705
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,793
What is there to do?

706
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:24,230
We're just gonna stay
in the street and drink beer

707
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,666
that Tyler stole
from his dad all night?

708
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,928
Yeah, we did that.

709
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,495
We're currently doing that.

710
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,149
But you know what,
we were talking about it.

711
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:32,281
The most fun that
we had all night

712
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,762
was scaring everyone
at that party, dude.

713
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:38,113
I mean, like, we need to take
advantage of this right now.

714
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,159
You make
such a convincing Gags.

715
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:41,551
[Sara] I don't
know about that.

716
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,902
Hell yeah, I do.

717
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:47,079
And I'm just saying,
Liz damn near shit her pants.

718
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:50,343
And this whole city is
about to do the same thing,

719
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,693
so let's just have a little
bit of fun with this, dude.

720
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,651
[Chris] I second this idea.

721
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,915
Yeah, well,
you guys go have fun.

722
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,481
I still wanna go home.

723
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,005
[Chris] But Sara,
we need you to be our third.

724
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,832
Who's gonna record everything?

725
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:03,008
[pop music playing over radio]

-Uh...
-Three letters.

728
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,580
I was going to say
Benedict Arnold.

729
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,974
That's way too many,
far more than three.

730
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,324
I'm just looking,
something traitor...

731

732
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,417
Oh, oh, get this,
look at this guy!

733
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,854
-Look at this guy!
-Oh, my God.

734
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,900
-You are fucking kidding.
-[Dale laughing]

735
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,731
[Dale] Oh, he's going down.
He's gonna-- Oh, and he went!

736
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:34,169
-Whoa, buddy, oh, oh!
-[Dale] We gotta interview him
about Gags!

737
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:35,866
Can we please interview him?

738
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,433
This is exactly
what Ron deserves.

739
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,523
[Dale laughing]

740
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,744
Green Bay, you never
cease to amaze me.

741
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,920
Dude is just wrecked.

742
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,401
Well, what exactly
did you have in mind?

743
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,837
We're just gonna go
to random houses

744
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,100
and throw water
balloons at 'em?

745
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,362
No.

746
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,364
We're gonna go downtown.

747
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,018
We're gonna scare
some real people.

748
00:32:57,062 --> 00:33:00,761
I mean, come on,
he's on everybody's mind.

749
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,893
We're just scaring them?

750
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,634
Yeah.

751
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:07,028
[Chris] But it's
going to be awesome.

752
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,160
Are you in?

00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,338

757
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,521
[male cop] Good evening, ma'am.
I'm responding to a phone call.

758
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,132
It's my daughter.
She's-- She's--

759
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,699
I don't know what's
gotten into her,

760
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:27,744
but she's not herself,
something's wrong.

761
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:28,963
The cops are here.

762
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,488
Okay. Ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to tell me

763
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,055
who's all in the house.

764
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,579
Oh, it's just me
and my two daughters,

765
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,842
Genna and my oldest
daughter Erin,

766
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:41,541
who's locked herself
in here and won't come out.

767
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:44,065
Okay, just the facts,
tell me what's going on.

768
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,809
Erin, she came home early.

769
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:52,421
Her and her two friends went out
looking for that damn clown.

770
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,467
She wasn't feeling good
and she was covered

771
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,816
in some sort of white powder.

772
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,035
That was cocaine.

773
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,732
Shut up, Genna.

774
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,301
I didn't put much
thought into it,

775
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:07,741
but then she went
into this trance

776
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,526
and she was holding
scissors in her hand

777
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,878
and she looked at me like
she wanted to hurt me.

778
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,837
She's been here ever since.

779
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,882
-May I?
-Yeah.

It's Officer Jacobs from the
Green Bay Police Department.

783

Why don't you come out here
so we can talk for a bit?

[clanking]

785
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,773
Did she have the scissors
with her when she went in?

786
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:41,731
-Yes.
-Hey, Erin?

787
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,516
Hey, you're worrying
your mother.

788
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,865
Yeah, I'm gonna come in
and check on you,

789
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,736
just make sure everything's
okay, all right?

Jesus, kid, you're
gonna have to let me in.

793
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,227
Unit 1-19, I'm gonna need
immediate assistance

794
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,447
on that 10-16 on Baird Street.

00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,157
Want one?

00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,246
No, keep those away
from me, I told you.

00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:29,127
Ugh. Ron, no thank you.

801
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,606
Really, you're not
gonna answer that?

802
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,782
No. I'm not
in the mood for his crap.

803
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,307
Well, you know
he can see you, right?

804
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,396
I'm not in the mood
for your crap, Ron.

805
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:40,964
He doesn't have anything
worthwhile for us,

806
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,140
you know that.

Oh.

810
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,673
Don't.

811
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,457
I mean, now I'm supposed
to ignore him too?

812
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,719
Dale!

813
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,156
Don't, don't, don't.

814
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:03,378
Hey, Ron.

815
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,075
Yeah, she is,
right next to me.

816
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,339
Yeah, hold on one sec.

817
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,820
Okay, you are good, Ron.

818
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,475
[Ron on speaker] Heather.

819
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,260
Hey, Ron, I must have
just missed your call.

820
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,696
Sorry about that.

821
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,567
Yeah, just stop right there.

822
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,135
I don't care to hear it.
How's your assignment?

823
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,964
Uh, it's going fine.

824
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:25,879
We interviewed
everyone you requested

825
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:28,621
and now we're just waiting
for the next big break.

826
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,884
Oh, the next
big break, huh?

827
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:33,974
Great. You remember
that nutjob Charles Wright

828
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:35,410
from the Wright Stuff Podcast?

829
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,370
Is that the guy
we interviewed last fall

830
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:39,849
when the NRA came into town?

831
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:41,851
Yeah, exactly.

832
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,592
Looks like he's
out there conducting

833
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,638
his own clown hunt tonight.

834
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,945
He asked if people wanted him to enforce "vigilante justice,"

835
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:51,121
since the GBPD
aren't doing enough,

836
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,775
according to him.

837
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:55,169
Wait, you mean
that he's gonna...?

838
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,997
Yeah, he's out there
looking for Gags

839
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,564
and he's gonna
put an end to him.

840
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:00,000
He began posting
Facebook Live videos

841
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,828
over an hour ago.

842
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:05,223
Holy shit, yes, this is
exactly what we needed, yes!

843
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,704
Yeah, you're right, this is exactly what we needed.

844
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,664
So tell me, why in the fuck
did Rebecca Chambers

845
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:15,233
just announce that WBSC
exclusive interview with him?

846
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,712
Wait, what did you just say?

847
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,932
Oh, you heard me.

848
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,934
What I wanna know
is how in the hell

849
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:23,458
did you miss the biggest
break in the Gags story?

850
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:26,287
Are you even paying attention to what you're doing out there?

851
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:28,550
Don't you put this
on me, okay?

852
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:31,031
I have done every
single one of your
pathetic fucknut interviews.

853
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:32,946
Who the fuck was that
Ed Gein motherfucker

854
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,382
at the antique store?

855
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:35,775
These pieces aren't news, Ron,

856
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:37,255
they're a goddamn joke.

857
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,908
You wanna tell me about what is

858
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:41,650
and isn't news,
sure, go ahead, fine.

859
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,304
Clearly you can't
tell what real news is

860
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,914
even when there's
some wannabe Batman

861
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,308
running around Green Bay
hunting a clown.

862
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,789
Somehow that didn't show up
on your radar, huh?

863
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:53,096
So please, go on,
Heather, enlighten me.

864
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,012
I did the best I could
with what you gave me.

865
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,058
Hell, I didn't even
want Gags Watch.

866
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:01,061
Good. 'Cause you're
not on it anymore.

867
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,932
Excuse me?

868
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:04,673
I've had enough
of your attitude

869
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,633
and having WBSC
snatch up the exclusives

870
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,810
without you even being
aware of the situation.

871
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,638
It's a pretty big fuckup.

872
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,988
You're officially
off the assignment.

873
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:19,079
Uh, wait, I'm sure we can
work something out, guys.

874
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,386
It's too late.
I already gave it to Nathan.

875
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,691
Nathan?

876
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,345
Yes, Nathan.

877
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,129
No, you cannot do this to me.

878
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:27,870
I worked my ass off for you.

879
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:30,046
I can do this, Heather.

880
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,744
And I just did.

881
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:34,137
Go home.
You're done for now.

882
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:36,226
But first, bring back
my fucking truck.

Good evening, Green Bay.

887
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:49,327
I'm Rebecca Chambers
reporting live for WBSC.

888
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,373
And we are proud to report
a fascinating development

889
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:56,159
in a story that has been
in the news this past week.

890
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,423
You better believe I'm gonna
act on my God-given right

891
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:02,122
to defend myself and put two
slugs in his [beep] lungs.

892
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:05,125
And the GBPD can hold me
accountable all they want.

893
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:07,345
'Cause guess what,
I hold myself accountable.

Charles Wright, host of
the Wright Stuff Podcast,

895
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,176
has opted
to take to the streets

896
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,179
in an effort
to find Gags the Clown.

897
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:19,705
To him, the joke has gone on
for far too long

898
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:22,316
and he is not laughing anymore.

899
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,754
[Charles] Rebecca, Americans
have to take our country back

900
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:28,540
and Charles Wright is here to set an example for you all.

901
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:32,021
Some may say,
including yours truly,

902
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:36,025
that you're taking this
a little too seriously.

903
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,289
Oh, am I? That's hilarious,
because for the last week

904
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,900
all I've been hearing from you

905
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,858
and all the other
crony news stations

906
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,599
is Gags, Gags, Gags.

907
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,167
So if anything,
my seriousness in the matter

908
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,429
is thanks to you.

909
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:50,039
[Rebecca]
Well, for all we know,

910
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,478
this can be someone's idea
of a prank.

911
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,393
That's right,
it could be a prank.

912
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,046
It could be a publicity stunt.

913
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,048
It could be
for some dumb horror movie

914
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,267
nobody's ever gonna see.

915
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,660
That doesn't change the fact

916
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,836
that he's out there
soliciting terror.

917
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:06,621
[Rebecca] So Gags
the clown is a terrorist?

918
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,667
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

919
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,625
Look, he's not
your just standard

920
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:14,107
garden variety
ISIS jihad terrorist.

921
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,152
You know, instead of hiding
behind a beard and a turban,

922
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,198
he's hiding
behind a clown mask.

923
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,461
But in the end,
he's still a terrorist.

924
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,681
-[man] Get him, Rock.
Get the clown.
-[dog barking]

925

Get the clown,
there's a good boy.

926
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,684
[Rebecca]
...it seems as if nobody's...

927
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:26,685
-...been able to find...
-[man] Good boy, Rock.

928
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,208
Gags the Clown.

929
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:31,341
What makes you think
that you will?

930
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:34,083
Not everybody was
a Marine for seven years.

931
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,172
Not everybody has
the knowledge that I have.

932
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:38,348
Look, I'm a trained soldier.

933
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,350
Hey, you sure you
don't wanna watch this?

934
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,788
[Heather] Goddamn van,
right, you piece of shit.

935
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,181
We'll take that as a no.

936
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,488
See, Gags isn't
some punk high schooler

937
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,142
with nothing better to do.

938
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:51,753
You could tell he's got
a plan of some sort.

939
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,886
And I am gonna foil that plan.

Her hair is stunning.

941
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,847

I will exercise any and all of my God-given rights

as an American.

944
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:05,811
[man] Oh, my God,
this guy is such a--

945
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,422
I don't believe him
for a second, okay?

946
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,251
...because Charles Wright
is looking for you.

947
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,166
Coming for you, pal!

948
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,647
And there you have it.

[urgent TV news theme playing]

952
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,617
[Rebecca] Thanks, Charles,
you did great!

953
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:34,579
It's just a guy
in a clown suit.

954
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:37,669
-You two know that, right?
-[Wayne] Listen up, toots.

955
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:40,149
You just do what you do,
let us do what we do, okay?

956
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:43,457
-Toots?
-Stay pretty
in front of the camera.

957
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,720
You two have a good night.

958
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:47,374
[Charles chuckles]
Thanks, we will.

959

[female operator on phone]
911, what's your emergency?

960
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,467
[woman on phone] Yeah, I was
just chased up the stairs

961
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,513
to my apartment by a person
dressed like a clown.

962
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,253
And now he's just standing
outside my front door.

963
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,733
[operator] Are you inside
the apartment now

964
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,648
and are your doors locked?

965
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:02,258
[woman] Yeah, but
he's just standing there
and he won't leave.

966
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,651
[operator]
What's your address?

967
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,566
[woman] 1506 Adams Street,
apartment seven.

968
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,394
[operator]
Do you know this person?

969
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:09,614
[woman]
No. Well, I don't know.
He's wearing a clown mask.

970
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,485
[operator] Has the
individual threatened you?

971
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,226
[woman] I consider
being chased by a clown

972
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:14,619
threatening, don't you?

973
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:19,058
[Chris laughing] Oh, man!
He's totally booking it.

974

[Tyler] Holy shit.

976
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,326
And you wanted to go home.

977
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,284

I stayed out, didn't I?

[police siren blaring

It's too fucking easy.

-After the day I had?
-Chris.

994
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,431
You're gonna pull
this shit on me?

995

[Tyler] Chris, get back
in the fucking car.
Chris, Chris, what the fuck?

Dude, that guy just
almost kicked your ass.

1001
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:44,926
Dude, Chris.
Chris, are you okay?

Fucking punks!

1005

It doesn't matter who Gags is.

1006
00:43:57,765 --> 00:44:00,463
That's what everybody wants us
to be worried about.

1007
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,988
But I tell you what,
Gags is just a distraction

1008
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:04,598
from the real issues.

1009
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,991
That's the problem
with what's going on

1010
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,427
with the media right now,

1011
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,864
is that they wanna
focus on these distractions,

1012
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:12,258
these entertainments,
instead of talking

1013
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:13,738
about the real issues.

1014
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:19,352

the easy way or the hard way?

[Jake] What the hell
is wrong with him?

1053
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:02,602
[Chrissy] He's dead,
that's what's wrong with him.

1054
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:05,431
Oh, what the hell was
he doing to himself?

1055
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:08,303
[Jake] I've seen
a lot of things in my day,

but nothing like that.

-Boom.

they won't let us in.

Why not?
I mean, it's a carnival.

-Keep driving.
-Ron said we had to--

1092
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,799
I don't care
what Ron says, this isn't over.

1093
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:56,498
This isn't over?
You wanted this over.

No more Gags Watch,
you got your wish.

I don't understand why
this isn't a good thing.

00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,246
Do you think he'll
find the clown?

1098
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,422
Better yet,
do you think he'd shoot him?

1099
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,642
I don't know, Heather.

1100
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:13,646
He's an entertainer,
not a murderer.

1101
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:16,301
I mean, you never can tell
with these wacko conservatives.

1102
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:17,737
One second they're praying,

1103
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,608
the next they're
lynching gay people

1104
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,871
and blowing up abortion clinics.

1105
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:25,701
-I think he would.
-Okay. And?

1106
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,877
And that's
the fucking story, Dale.

1107
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:29,488
No one gave a damn
about the clown.

1108
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:32,273
He's standing around, people
are taking pictures, big deal.

1109
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:35,059
Someone with the intent
of killing him,

1110
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,756
that's
a one-in-a-million exclusive.

1111
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:38,932
That's worldwide news.

1112
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,064
Bec already got
the interview.

1113
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:42,892
Gah, stop calling her Bec. Ugh.

1114
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:44,720
She just interviewed the guy.

1115
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:46,635
All right, let's find him.

1116
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,550
Let's tail him,
wait and see what he does.

1117
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:50,378
If it's nothing, it's nothing.

1118
00:49:50,422 --> 00:49:52,293
We go home and we deal
with Ron on Monday.

1119
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:54,687
But if we catch this guy

1120
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,428
in the act of killing,

1121
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:58,038
or even threatening
someone with a gun

1122
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,518
because they're
dressed like a clown,

1123
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:02,260
both our careers skyrocket.

1124
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,175
Ron said he wanted the van--

1125
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:07,047
-Ron wanted a Gags exclusive.
-And it's my ass!

1126
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,180
And we can still deliver that.

1127
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:11,704
Please. Please, please, please.

1128
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:17,536
Goddamn it, Duprey,
you're a bad influence.

1129
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,059
Attaboy!

1130
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:20,452
How you doing, folks?

1131
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:22,410
Charles Wright of
the Wright Stuff Podcast

1132
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:23,716
checking in with you.

1133
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:25,283
We just caught wind
of a new photo

1134
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:27,067
going viral, taken when?

1135
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,678
[Wayne] 22 minutes ago,
Eastside Industrial Park.

1136
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:31,028
Thank you, Wayne.

1137
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,030
Now, scanner's been
poppin' off all night

1138
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,858
with pranks
and copycats and what not.

1139
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,295
But this photo looks legit

1140
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:39,819
and the location
fits our guy's MO.

1141
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:41,429
So we're gonna
head on over there,

1142
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:43,823
we're gonna ditch the wheels
and continue on foot.

1143
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:45,216
Stay tuned.
[clicks tongue]

1144
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,871
I don't see him,
where the hell is he?

1145
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:50,308
[Sara] I'm telling you,
he's gonna chicken out.

1146
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:52,179
He's not gonna show.

1147
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:53,485
I should have wore
the damn thing.

1148
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:54,747
[gaming bell sounds]

1149
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,402
-[Sara] Heh, he did it.
-[Tyler] Where?

1150
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:59,056
-He's right over there. He--
-Where do you see him?

1151
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:01,101
Where?

1152
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:02,885
[Sara] I-- I just saw him.

1153
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,887
[Tyler] Look,
I don't see shit, okay?

1154
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:10,067
[Sara] Wait, huh?
Did that really just happen?

1155
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:14,897
Hey. What are
we looking at?

1156
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:17,335
[Sara] Wait, weren't you
just over there?

1157
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:19,337
-There?
-[Sara] Yeah, over there.

1158
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,686
-No.
-Dude.

1159
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,951
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

1160
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:27,171
I'm eating cotton candy
at a carnival.

1161
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,827
They wouldn't let me in
with the costume on, I'm sorry.

1162
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:33,786
You jackass, man. I told you

1163
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,788
to put the thing on
after you came in here.

1164
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:40,923
I know. Sorry.

1165
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:43,056
[Sara] So, what
are we gonna do,

1166
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,492
we're just gonna go?

1167
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,146
No.

1168
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,017
We're gonna go ride the
Tilt-a-Whirl at least twice.

1169
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,149
Yeah.

1170
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,629
This dick shine here's
paying for me.

1171
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:52,283
-[Sara] Seriously?
-Yeah, seriously.

1172
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:58,463
This has to be related
to the parking ramp.

1173
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:01,379
-No shit? I'll be damned.
-[police radio chatter]

1174
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:03,294
Did you know they're
not actual bath salts?

1175
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,469
That's just slang.

1176
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:07,994
I had no idea.

1177
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:10,823
Detective Perkins.
Officer Chrissy Renard here.

1178
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,130
Have there been any developments
to the homicide investigation

1179
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:16,133
of the Pine Street
parking ramp from
earlier this evening?

1180
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,962
We've just had an
encounter with a suspect

1181
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:24,097
who resembled a description
from that one eyewitness we had.

1182
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,882
Can't help but think
they're connected.

1183
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:30,190
Bath salts usually
contain the cathinone

1184
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,976
methylenedexa-- Wow.

1185
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,674
No wonder why
they just call them bath salts.

1186
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:37,284
I can't pronounce
any of these words.

1187
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,113
Okay, thank you.

1188
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:50,428
This is bigger than we thought.

1189
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:52,952
What do we got?

1190
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:56,564
I guess the hospitals have
had a few patients tonight

1191
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:59,872
who've had similar symptoms
as to what we just witnessed.

1192
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:04,616
Self mutilation, disorientation,
hyperadrenal disorder.

1193
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:08,359
So what is it,
some kind of virus?

1194
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,839
No idea.

1195
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:14,147
They've all disappeared.

1196
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,500
[tense theme playing]

1197
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:20,632
[people screaming]

1198
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:21,981
Oh, my God.

1199
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:24,462
I hate you so much!

1200
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:36,038
If you were a semi-delusional

1201
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:38,780
conservative podcast host
carrying a gun

1202
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:41,914
looking for a clown,
where would you be?

1203
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,134
Church?

1204
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:47,833
[Wayne] Hey, yo, hold up,

1205
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:50,009
the picture was
taken back there.

1206
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,620
Right, that picture was
posted 30 minutes ago.

1207
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:54,143
He already got what he wanted.

1208
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,407
Somebody snapped
his picture, posted it online,

1209
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,017
give him his attention fix.

1210
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,106
He's long gone.
I'm interested in where he went.

1211
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:01,803
[Wayne] Well, dude, come on,
let's just take a look, huh?

1212
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,501
I'm telling you,
he's not there anymore,

1213
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,111
you fucking idiot, let's go.

1214
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:06,808
[Wayne] Hey, you better check
your tone with me, Charles.

1215
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:09,202
I'm not one of your pansy
ass fanboys, you got me?

1216
00:54:11,596 --> 00:54:15,077
Okay. Here's why we're
not going down that way.

1217
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,906
'Cause it'd be a waste of time.
Think about it.

1218
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:21,867
He's always in one spot
and then poof, gone.

1219
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,609
Now, a guy dressed like that,
he doesn't just disappear,

1220
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:27,525
not with the attention he gets
and the people looking for him.

1221
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:30,354
So I figure he's gotta
have a vehicle of some sort

1222
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:32,225
or a mode of transportation,

1223
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,054
so he can just jump in
and take off without any hassle.

1224
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:37,361
So that's what we're
looking for, okay?

1225
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,668
Remember, this is my show.

1226
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:41,930
I'm driving this bitch.

1227
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:43,280
You're just along for the ride.

1228
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:47,719
[Wayne] Fucking asshole.

1229
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:49,068
[Sara] You guys,
what are we doing?

1230
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:50,635
They're about to close.

1231
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:53,681
-That's what we're doing, look.
-[Sara] Really?

1232
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,988
It's a black balloon.

1233
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:57,946
You gotta get that
for the costume.

1234
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,035
You totally do, you gotta go.
Go, go, go!

1235
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,254
[Sara] But...

1236
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:10,481
Look, this is a Gags
original black balloon.

1237
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,134
You gotta get a photo,
you gotta get a photo.

1238
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:13,919
-[Tyler] Totally on it.
-[Sara] You don't know that.

1239
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:15,399
[Sara] There are thousands
of balloons here.

1240
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,748
It could be anyone's.

1241
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:19,228
Sara, can you
just be happy for once

1242
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:21,318
-for me and my new balloon?
-[popping]

[Tyler and Sara laughing]

1244
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:26,148
[Sara] What just happened?

1245
00:55:26,192 --> 00:55:27,628
Turn off the camera.

1246
00:55:27,672 --> 00:55:30,109
[ominous theme playing]

1247
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,765
I said turn off
the fucking camera!

1248
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:36,202
What'd I tell you?
Never the same place twice.

1249
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,247
[Wayne] Wait,
let me get it on camera.

[Wayne]
Goddamn, that bastard's creepy.

1251
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:45,167
Okay, go live.

1252
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,952
-[Wayne] Now?
-No, next month.

1253
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:49,433
[Wayne] All right,
give me a second.

1254
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:51,652
Okay, we're live, go.

1255
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,088
Boy, oh boy, folks.

1256
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:54,960
Things are about
to get exciting.

1257
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,092
I'm standing here at
the Eastside Industrial Park

1258
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,442
just off of Quincy.

1259
00:55:58,485 --> 00:55:59,791
Guess who we just found.

1260
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,231
[Wayne] Yeah,
we found him, boy.

1261
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:08,234
[Charles]
Shh, of course we did.

1262
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:10,192
Now, for all

1265
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:16,198
this is the real deal, folks.
This is not staged.

My city's clown problem
ends tonight. You ready?

1272
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:33,259
[Wayne]
Hell yeah, let's do it.

[ominous theme playing]

Well, well, well...
if it isn't Gags the Clown.

1275
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,409
Pretty popular these days,
aren't you?

1276
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,236
Weren't too hard
to track down though,

1277
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,890
if I may say so myself.

1278
00:56:58,023 --> 00:57:00,808
Listen, why don't you cut
the act and come over here?

1279
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:03,202
We'll have a little
chat face to face.

1280
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:06,335
No more balloons,
no more bullshit.

1281
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,731
Look, man...

1282
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:14,387
this clown shit stops now,
you hear me?

1283
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,128
I'm not having it anymore.

1284
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:19,174
My city
ain't having it anymore.

1285
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:22,264
You had your fun,
got a bunch of people scared,

1286
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:24,092
received
all kinds of attention,

1287
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:27,269
but this stops now!

1288
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:29,097
So why don't
you come on over here,

1289
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:32,405
take off that fucking mask
and go the fuck home!

1290

2500 viewers, Charlie.

Hell, yeah.

1292
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,237
I'm not gonna ask you again.

1293

[Wayne] Draw it!

1294
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,025
[Charles]
You really wanna do this?

1295
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,681
Goddamn it!

1296
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:50,162
[Wayne] Shoot him,
Charlie, shoot him!

1297
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:51,816
This is your last chance!

-[Wayne] I-- I don't know.

1300
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,912
Hey, where did he go?

1301
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:05,394
He was right here,
did he just run off?

1302
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,571
[Wayne] Come on, man,
you gotta find him!

1303
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:09,398
Don't let him get away!

1304
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:13,968
What the...?

1305
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:15,579
Oh, man, come on!

1306
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:19,278
You gotta be kidding me.

1307
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:22,324
No, no, no, no.
This doesn't make
any fucking sense.

1308
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:23,630
[Wayne] What's up?
He couldn't just disappear.

1309
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:24,936
Where'd he go?

[train horn blaring in distance]

Where was
that music coming from?

1312
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:29,418
[Wayne] I don't know.

1313
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,381
We blew it.

1314
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:38,210
[Wayne]
No man. You blew it.

Chris just puked up a gallon
of Jaeger in the bathroom.

1324
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,238
[Sara] But you guys
weren't drinking Jaeger.

1325
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:08,762
Well, he clearly was.
He just blew chunks
all over the place.

1326
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:11,199
I am posting this shit
right now.

00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,464
Do I look like his doctor?

Whoa.

You don't look so good.

Puke and rally, boy.

1333

[Sara] Are you sure
you're okay?

1334
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:29,566
Do you want us
to take you home?

1335
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,959
Hey, guys, guys,
check this out.

1336
00:59:32,003 --> 00:59:33,831
There's this guy,
this crazy dude.

1337
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,484
He's been hunting
Gags all night

1338
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:37,791
and apparently found him
and then totally chickened out.

1339
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:39,271
[Sara] What do you mean,
hunting Gags?

1340

-Who is he?
-I don't know.

-It's not good.

They're calling you
a chump, you know that?

1348
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,463
Just another coward
who's all talk.

1349
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:59,204
They don't even think
you had the thing loaded.

1350
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,597
I wasn't sure it was him.

Oh, of course it was him.

have a clean shot.
-[Wayne] Bullshit!

Look, I just can't
kill a guy, Wayne, okay?

1354
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:08,909
You do understand that, right?

1355
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,478
Could have been anybody
under that mask.

1356
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:13,740
I mean, it could have
been an undercover cop

1357
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,046
for all I know.

1358

[Wayne]
An undercover cop, really?

1359
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:21,095
You think it was a cop
who was dressed as the clown?

1360

Just give me
a goddamn break already.

1361

You know, here's
the bottom line.

1362
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:27,928
You told your viewers,
your great amazing fans,

1363
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:29,930
that you were gonna
find this clown

1364
01:00:29,974 --> 01:00:31,453
and put a stop to him

1403
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:29,528
[Tyler] Sara! This is my car.

1404
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:31,791
So could you stop being
a drag for once in your life...

1405
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:33,924
-...and turn the damn car?
-[Chris coughing]

1406
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:37,710
-[Tyler] Turn now.
-No.

1407
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,321
-Are you kidding me? Turn.
-No!

1408
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:43,107
-[Tyler] Sara, turn
the fucking car right.
-Okay, okay fine, I'm turning.

1409
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,457
-Tyler, let go!
-Jesus Christ.

1410
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,372
We got one more prank.

1411
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:51,768
Save the best one for last,
we'll fucking do it.

[tense theme playing]

1413
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:16,793
[Wayne] You really
think this is Gags?

1414
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:18,577
Who the hell else would it be?

1415
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,492
[Wayne] Well, I don't know,
maybe somebody who watched

1416
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,973
the video and then
started messing with you.

1417
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:26,585
Hey, I just find it
hard to believe that

1418
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:28,326
the clown would run off
to an industrial park

1419
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:30,676
and then leave a trail of
balloons for us to find him.

1420
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,460
Wayne, are you coming or what?

1421
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:34,332
[Wayne] Well, maybe
I am and maybe I ain't!

1422
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:35,637
[Charles] Fine.

1423
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:37,335
Suit yourself, I don't need you.

1424
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:41,513
[Wayne] Ah, I'm coming.
It's way too much fun

1425
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:43,558
watching this Charles
Wright train derail.

1426

Be advised, Charles Wright,

possible suspect on officer
down call in Vic Theatre.

1428

Male white, mid 40s,
with a military haircut...

01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:02,926
You see this?
It's him.

1430
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,842
[Wayne] So now what,
fearless leader?

1431
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:08,192
Go live.

1432
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:10,934
-Oh, you want me to go live?
-Go to live.

1433
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:13,327
[Wayne] All right, we're live.

This is Charles Wright.

1435
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:18,463
I'm standing about a mile
or so as the crow flies

1436
01:04:18,506 --> 01:04:20,900
from our last encounter
with Gags the Clown.

1437
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:22,641
And I want all of you
out there to know

1438
01:04:22,684 --> 01:04:24,251
this isn't over.

1439
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:26,340
Sure, I was a little
lenient with the clown.

1440
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:28,777
What can I say, I'm a nice guy.

1441
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:31,955
But I assure you, he's not
gonna get strike three.

1442
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:33,913
It's now or never.

1443
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:36,829
Cut the live video.

1444
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:39,919
[Wayne] Live video is cut.

1445

Hey, wait. You're not
seriously going in there?

1446

Come on.

1447
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:48,101

they put cream in it.

1451
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,210
I asked for black.

1452
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,734
I specifically
said black coffee.

1453

Oh, son of a bitch.

1454

-Do you wanna go back?
-Yes, I would like to go back.

1455
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:20,917
Then go back,
Jesus Christ, it's cream.

-Damn it.
-Just go run in
and get a-- Holy shit!

This is Charles Wright...

Charles Wright says
he's found Gags again.

1459
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:29,795
He says he's at
an abandoned building

1460
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:32,885
about a mile or so away
from the industrial park?

1461
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,192
What's abandoned out there?

1462
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,542
The old Larsen Green Mill.

1463
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:40,980
-My old man used to work there.
-Let's go there.

1464
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,591
All right, hold on,
I'm gonna swing back, I gotta
get this coffee switched.

what am I doing in here?

Ah, Jesus.

he can't even move.

1471

[Tyler] Whatever.
You still got one left in you,

1472
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:24,154
don't you, buddy?

1473
01:06:24,197 --> 01:06:26,243
Yeah, man.

I'm taking him to the hospital.

[Tyler] Come on,
don't do anything stupid.

1477
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:36,079
No, Tyler,
you don't be stupid.

1478
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:39,082
What do you plan to achieve
here, what are you doing?

1479
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,781
[Tyler] We're going to go
screw with those podcast guys.

1480
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:45,262
Right, 'cause you want
Chris to dress like a clown

1481
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,829
to go prank a guy
who wants to shoot a clown.

Just think about this
for a second, you moron!

[Tyler] Whatever!
Oh, come on, he's all show.

1484
01:06:52,138 --> 01:06:54,227
He's obviously carrying
around a fake gun.

1485
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:56,403
He's just trying
to get stupid publicity

1486
01:06:56,447 --> 01:06:57,796
for his dumb show.

1487
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,711
Think about it.

1488
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:01,887
Fine, then you go do it.

1489
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,498
You go be Gags.
But we're leaving.

Oh, but guess what?
You're gonna walk.

'Cause you aren't
gonna be taking my car.

419 Elizabeth Street.

1511
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,175
It's the old Larsen
Green Building.

1512
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:18,964
When was the last
clown sighting?

1513
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:20,835
Be more specific.

1514
01:08:20,879 --> 01:08:22,446
There was one
in the Fox River Trail,

1515
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:24,404
one in the K.I. Center,
one off of Bayshore Drive,

1516
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:26,450
one at the fairgrounds.

1517
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,930
All within
the last two hours or so.

1518
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:31,498
All locations on the East
Side close to the vicinity

1519
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,196
on Elizabeth Street, correct?

1520
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,460
Yeah, I guess.

1521
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:39,985
All fairly close.

1522
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:42,770
And the first Gags sighting
was under the Mason Bridge,

1523
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:44,163
maybe a mile away?

1524
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:49,734
Look at you,
doing police work.

1525
01:08:52,954 --> 01:08:56,915
[Heather] Holy shit, Dale.
First day?

to an empty card.

1527
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,920
You said that
you just wanted me recording.

01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:06,490
Okay, we're good.

1530
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:11,190
And...rolling.

1531
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,932
I'm standing outside
of the old Larsen Green Mill

1532
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:16,021
on the East Side of Green Bay,

1533
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,806
a building that stood empty
for the last 15 years.

1534
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,547
But tonight its doors reopen

1535
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:22,549
as local celebrity

Wright Stuff Podcast,

enters the building on his hunt

1538
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:27,902
for Gags the Clown.

1539

Stay tuned
as we remain on location

1540
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:31,993
as this developing
story unfolds.

1541
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:34,300
For WGRB, I'm Heather Duprey.

1542
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:37,173
[Dale] And got it.

1543
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:39,610
How was that?

1544
01:09:39,653 --> 01:09:41,916
[Dale] It's not
your best work.

1545
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,223
Go fuck yourself.

1546
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,920
Come on, let's go.

1547
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:47,357
[Dale] Wait,
we're going inside?

1548
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,488
Yes, keep rolling.

1549
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:53,841
[Dale] You really think
that's wise?

1550
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:56,975
Dale, I'm gonna need you
to man up, okay?

1551
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:58,803
Find your balls, find them,

1552
01:09:58,846 --> 01:10:00,326
or I will find them for you.

1553
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:03,068
[Dale] I should probably
report that to HR.

1554
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:04,896
But I'll let it slide.

1555
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:07,028
-The mouth on this woman.
-[Heather] Okay...

01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:09,727
Hold up.

1557
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,339
[Heather sighs]

1558
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:24,263
[laughs] Hey, MacGyver.

1559
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:26,134
You really think
that's gonna work?

1560
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,317
Where'd you learn to do that?

1561
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,971
MacGyver. [scoffs]

1562
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:40,975
[Dale] MacGyver.

[tense theme playing]

1564
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:01,692
-[Wayne] Ah, shit!
-Easy over there.

1565
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:02,954
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

1566
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:04,477
Hey, fuck you, man.

1567
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:07,045
I've about had it with this
little exploration of yours.

1568
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:10,744
You had your shot at Gags
and you blew it, remember that?

1569
01:11:10,788 --> 01:11:12,268
Big tough Marine
almost pissed himself

1570
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:13,617
while staring down a clown?

1571
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:15,488
You better fucking watch it.

1572
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:17,708
Go ahead, push me to the edge,
see where it gets you.

1573
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:21,059
[Wayne] Oh, yeah, right,
I'm pushing you to the edge.

1574
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:22,321
You know what, man?

1575
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,975
-Forget this shit, okay?
-Shut up.

1576
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:25,672
-I'm gonna head back--
-Shut the fuck up!

[eerie circus theme playing

1578
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,632
Listen.

1579
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:32,810
What the hell is that?

1580
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:35,073
It's that same shit
we heard on the tracks.

1581
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:36,553
Come on.

1582
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,993
[Tyler] Ah, damn it, Chris.

1583
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:43,821
I told you to stay by me.

1584
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,779
Where the hell are you?

1585
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:47,390
I should have
gone home with Sara.

1586
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:52,003
Whoa, what the fuck?
Oh, no, no no.

1587
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:55,223
That's a big fucking no.
No, no, no.

1588
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:57,269
[dispatcher] 1-11,
what's your location?

1589
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:01,491
[male cop] I just had
a goddamn balloon pop on me.

1590
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:04,537
[Dale] It's been like
an hour and a half.

1591
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,799
It's been five minutes.

1592
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:08,585
Do you have
any sense of adventure?

1593
01:12:08,628 --> 01:12:11,109
[Dale] I have
a sense of not dying.

1594
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:13,764
You're not gonna die.
Stop being a fucking pussy.

1595
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:16,332
[Dale] Can you go five minutes
without calling me a pussy?

1596
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,334
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
over the queefing.

[tense theme playing]

1598
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,997
We're close.
There's something going on here.

1599
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:32,913
-Just keep recording.
-[Wayne] Don't you worry.

1600
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,393
I'm recording the whole thing.

What the hell's going on here?

1606

[Charles]
Hey, stop right there.

1607

-You ain't
getting away this time!

[eerie circus theme playing
over speakers in distance]

1610
01:12:58,635 --> 01:13:00,854
[Chrissy] Shots fired
at 419 Elizabeth Street,

1611
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,290
requesting backup.

1612
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:06,251
[Wayne] Holy shit.

1613
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:10,864
You shot him.

1614
01:13:10,908 --> 01:13:12,170
[Charles]
He was...

1615
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:14,999
[Charles] He was coming in.

1616
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:17,218
[Wayne] I can't believe it,
you actually fucking shot him.

1617
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:20,700
You just shot Gags the Clown.

1618
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:25,313
Is he dead?

1619
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:35,498
[Wayne] Man, he's deader
than a doornail.

1620
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,635
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
calm down, killer.

1621
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:45,159
It's just like them terrorists
you blasted overseas,

1622

it's no different.

1623
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,771
I...

1624
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:50,208
I never killed anyone ever.

1625
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,731
[Wayne] Wait, wait.

1626
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:53,820
Are you fucking kidding me?

1627
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:56,432
I was a mechanic over there.

1628
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,042
I fixed humvees.

1629
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:00,261
I never saw combat.

[Wayne] Oh... Oh, look at you.

1632
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:10,271
Aren't you the most pathetic
fucking coward I ever seen?

1633
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,014
He was yelling for help.

1634
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,758
-You did this.
-[Wayne] Me?

1635
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:21,500
[Wayne] Hey, don't you
pin this on me, huh?

1636
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:23,502
You're driving
this bitch, remember?

01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:25,330
-[Charles] Mm-mmm.
-[Wayne] Your own words.

1638
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:28,899
It's your fucking fault,
you did this.

1639
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:31,684
[Wayne] I got you
on camera, Charles.

1640
01:14:31,728 --> 01:14:33,991
Video evidence of you
shooting the sumbitch.

you want, clown killer,

1643
01:14:38,735 --> 01:14:39,866
I'm out of here.

1644
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:42,782
[Charles] Wait--

[Jake] The city still has
juice flowing to the building.

1647
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,189
Last I heard they were
gonna turn this whole thing

1648
01:14:58,232 --> 01:14:59,364
into a luxury condominium.

1649

[Chrissy] I got something.

1650
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,237
[Jake] Shit!

1651
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:05,152
Is that him?
Is that our clown?

[Chrissy] 1-12 here
at 419 Elizabeth Street.

01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,722
I have subject down,
possible PNB,

-[Jake] Anything?
-No, he's dead.

1656

[Jake] Chrissy, wait.

1657
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,737
-No.
-Damn.

1658
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:26,609
[Jake] Just a kid.

1659
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:30,047
It's Tyler Zepnick,
Sara's boyfriend.

1660
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,701
[Jake] Ah, jeez.

01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,883
[Chrissy]
Hey, sweetie, is Sara home?

1662
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:42,059
Yeah, no, no, no, it's okay,
everything's fine.

1663
01:15:42,102 --> 01:15:43,321
Look, I have to go.

1664
01:15:45,192 --> 01:15:47,455
Split up.
I take north, you take south.

1665
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:49,240
[Jake] We stay put
and wait for backup!

1666
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:50,676
[Chrissy]
I'm not waiting 15 minutes!

1667
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,157
[Jake] Chrissy!

1668
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,680
Damn it.

[eerie circus theme playing
over speakers in distance]

1670
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,206
[Dale] So instead of
running out of the building

1671
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,295
at the sound of
creepy carnival music,

1672
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:02,775
we're following it?

1673
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:05,822
Oh, Jesus Christ, Dale,
why can't you just be happy

1674
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:09,086
for the surprising developments
this story's presenting us, hmm?

1675
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,611
Now, help me figure out
where this is coming from.

1676
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,181
[Dale] I don't
feel like I'm wearing

1677
01:16:17,224 --> 01:16:19,313
the proper footwear here.

1678
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,841
[Dale whispers] I can smell
the asbestos in here.

1679
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,540
Oh, huh.

1680
01:16:35,155 --> 01:16:37,244
[Jake] Picked up on something.

1681
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,333
Pursuing one,
possibly two suspects.

1682
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:40,421
Whoa!

1683
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,476
[Dale] Whoa, watch it.

1684
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:53,652
I don't think you wanna
go walking through there.

1685
01:16:55,523 --> 01:16:57,134
It's coming from down here.

1686
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:05,664
[Dale] Ah, I just kind of
saved your life back there.

1687
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:07,274
Thank you would be nice.

1688
01:17:07,318 --> 01:17:09,755
Oh, please, I wasn't
gonna fall through.

1689
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:11,757
[Wayne] These damn things.
More importantly, how do
I get out--

1690
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:14,542
Hey buddy, can you tell me,
what's your name-- Oh, whoa!

1691
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:16,327
What the hell happened to you?

1692
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,068
The show is about to begin.

1693
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:19,983
[Wayne stammers] You go ahead
and start the show without me,

1694
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:21,245
okay, pal?
I'm getting the fu--

Sara, pick up!

Hey, it's Sara.

1699
01:17:44,355 --> 01:17:46,052
Surprisingly, I don't
have my phone on me,

1700
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,141
but you know what to do
and when to do it.

It's coming from in here.

1703
01:18:06,856 --> 01:18:08,509
[Dale] Oh, dear God.

1704
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:12,513
[Dale]
Ah, it's boarded shut.

1705
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:14,428
I guess we can't go in there.

1706
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:22,306
[panting]

1707
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:23,742
Come help me.

1708
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:25,483
[Dale] You're not
at all concerned

1709
